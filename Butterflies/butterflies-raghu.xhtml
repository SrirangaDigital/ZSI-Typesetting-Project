<p class="chap-title">Author's Preface</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The</span> study of butterflies, even of Indian species, has progressed largely during the thirty years or so which have elapsed since the publication of Bingham's work in this series. During the past ten years it was felt that a revision of Bingham was necessary, even though the work of Evans, in 1932, helped to fill the gap to a great extent.
</p>

<p>
Much new knowledge of the subject has been acquired since 1907, and the work of co-ordinating this has involved the almost entire re-writing of Bingham's work, though many of the original descriptions have been used.
</p>

<p>
In recent years a study of the works of the older naturalists has resulted in new ideas on the subject of nomenclature; and in consequence a number of names hitherto well known to students have had to be changed. In accordance, too, with the increase in our knowledge of the various groups, it will be found that the classification differs in some respects from that adopted in most works hitherto. On the other hand, the arrangement of species is much the same as that adopted by Evans, already an advance upon older systems.
</p>

<p>
All available information upon the habits and life-history of the species has been incorporated in the volume. The early stages of many species still remain unknown, and much information of other kinds is still lacking. For example, the exact limits of distribution of many forms still remains to be worked out, as well as the extent to which subspecies overlap and the nature of various individual forms. There is much confusion in the genus <i>Parnassius</i>, and this is unlikely to be cleared up until more intensive collecting can be done in the higher Himalayan valleys, and adequate data obtained. It is not enough to have the name of a locality and the month of capture : it is also important to know what forms actually fly on the same ground. Our knowledge of geographical races is, in many cases, still inadequate. It has thus been impossible in this volume to give full details of distribution : a species which may be regarded as rare over a certain area may yet be quite common in a few restricted places.
</p>

<p>
The Introduction to this volume has been considerably extended to cover the entire range of the subject. No similar account is to be found in any single entomological text-book, and only in the work of Evans (1932) was the subject treated at all fully. This latter work has served as a basis for the present Introduction.
</p>

<p>
The illustrations are from a variety of sources. Those used in Bingham's work have been, for the most part, used again, and a few errors have been corrected. Owing to the large number of figures in the text&#x2014;in the opinion of the author a very desirable feature&#x2014;the number of coloured plates has had to be curtailed. Plates I and II are from drawings generously presented by T. R. Bell, Esq., C.I.E., and Plate III is reproduced from Bingham.

<p class="title">INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF BUTTERFLIES, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDIAN SPECIES.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="smallcaps">History of the Study of Indian Butterflies.</span></p>

<p>The first account of Indian butterflies was published in 1857 by Horsfield and Moore in their `Catalogue of the Lepidoptera in the Museum of the Honourable the East India Company,' in which many species from Java were included, and a number of excellent coloured figures were given of larvæ and pupæ. Until the publication of this book little attention had been paid to Indian butterflies, though a number of the more familiar species had been figured in the more general works of older authors. The next step was the publication in 1865 of a paper by Moore in the Proc. Zool. Soc. on ``The Lepidopterous Insects of Bengal.'' Then followed various papers by Moore and Butler on new butterflies from India.</p>

<p>The earliest really comprehensive work was Moore's `Lepidoptera of Ceylon,' the first volume of which appeared in 1881; this contained detailed descriptions and coloured figures of all the species then known to occur in the island.</p>

<p>In 1881 Lionel de Nic\'eville began a series of papers in the `Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal' and in the `Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society.' In collaboration with Mr. Wood-Mason he issued comprehensive lists of the butterflies of Cachar and the Andaman Islands, as well as useful revisions of various genera. In 1882, in collaboration with Major G. F. L. Marshall, he published the first volume of `The Butterflies of India, Burma and Ceylon.' The second volume appeared in 1886, followed by the third in 1890, both by de Nic\'eville, Marshall having died in the interval. Two other projected volumes were never published, as de Nic\'eville died in 1901. These three volumes contain a wealth of detail, and constitute perhaps the most important contribution to the study of Indian butterflies that has yet been produced. This work deals with all but the Papilionidæ, Pieridæ, and Hesperiidæ.</p>

<p>In 1890 Moore commenced the publication of the `Lepidoptera Indica,' in which he gave a complete description and figure of every known butterfly, besides numerous notes on their habits and distribution. This work ran to ten quarto volumes, of which Moore was responsible for seven before his death; the remaining three volumes were written by the late Colonel Charles Swinhoe, and were completed in 1913.</p>

<p>In 1905 Colonel C. T. Bingham's first volume on butterflies appeared in the `Fauna of British India' series; this volume contained the families Danaidæ, Satyridæ, Amathusiidæ, Nymphalidæ, and Riodinidæ. Volume II, containing the Papilionidæ, Pieridæ, and part of the Lycænidæ, was issued in 1907, but unfortunately Bingham died before another volume could be written.</p>

<p>Apart from various local lists and general notes, the only other works that have been published on the butterflies of India as a whole are :&#x2014;</p>

<p><ul>
	<li class="roman">`List of Indian Butterflies' (W. H. Evans, 1912). ``The Identification of Indian Butterflies'' (W. H. Evans), first published in the `Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society' between 1922 and 1926, and re-issued in book form in 1927. A second edition of this most valuable handbook was published in 1932.</li>
	<li>`The Butterflies of India' (C. B. Antram, 1924). This work covers only a part of the Indian area, and many species, including all the Lycænidæ and Hesperiidæ, are omitted.</li>
	<li>`A Guide to Collecting Butterflies of India' (H. D. Peile, 1937). This work gives details of over 600 forms, with much information on the habits, and contains 25 plates, including one in colour. It is a useful handbook for the beginner, based principally on the author's personal experiences in North-West India.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The following important publications should be consulted by the student :&#x2014;</p>

<p>`Hesperiidæ Indicæ' (E. Y. Watson, 1891).</p>

<p>`Classification of the Hesperiidæ' (E. Y. Watson, 1893). This was world-wide in its application, but was adapted to the Indian fauna in 1894 (`Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society').</p>

<p>``The Common Butterflies of the Plains of India,'' by L. C. H. Young in the `Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society,' from 1905 to 1907, after which date, consequent upon his death, the series was continued by T. R. D. Bell (1909-1927). Bell's papers contain very detailed descriptions of the early stages, probably the most elaborate accounts of larvæ and pupæ ever written.</p>

<p>`The Butterflies of Ceylon' (W. Ormiston, 1924).</p>

<p>`The Macrolepidoptera of the World' (Dr. A. Seitz) : issued in parts, and written by various specialists. It gives brief descriptions of every known species and form, with a great many coloured figures. The Indian species are dealt with in the Indo-Australian and Palæarctic sections.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="smallcaps">II. Life-History.</span></p>

<p>All butterflies, like many other insects, only reach maturity after passing through a series of stages :&#x2014;</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>The <i>egg</i> or embryonic stage.</li>
	<li>The <i>larva</i> (caterpillar) or growing stage.</li>
	<li>The <i>pupa</i> (chrysalis) or resting stage.</li>
	<li>The <i>imago</i> (butterfly) or sexually mature stage.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>The transition from the larval to the imaginal (adult) stage is termed metamorphosis. The change of form is a double one, first from caterpillar to chrysalis, secondly from chrysalis to butterfly.</p>

<p>The length of time in the egg stage is variable; in the case of some Lycænidæ the winter is passed in this stage.</p>

<p>The larval stage is generally the longest. It varies with the species and climate, and may extend from a few days to many months. In regions with a cold winter season the larvæ of some species hibernate, and commence feeding again in the spring.</p>

<p>All butterfly larvæ are vegetable feeders, with the exception of certain Lycænidæ, which devour Coccidæ (scale insects), Aphididæ, and Membracidæ; other Lycænids live in the nests of ants and devour the ant-larvæ. The food-plants cover a very wide range from grasses to trees, and in the case of some African Lycænidæ include even lichens. A species may be restricted to a particular plant, or may be omnivorous. Some Lycænidæ feed inside the fruit of the guava and pomegranate and others upon flowers. Cannibalism sometimes occurs. The first meal of the newly-hatched larva is often its own empty egg-shell.</p>

<p>During development the larva casts its skin, or moults, as a rule five times; moulting is more accurately termed <i>ecdysis</i>. The period between two successive ecdyses is called an <i>instar</i>. Before the skin is case the larva becomes quiescent for a short period. When moulting begins, the skin of the head is case entire, and the skin of the body splits down the dorsum (or back) along segments 2, 3, and 4. The larva often eats the cast skin. In many species each instar shows a progressive change in colour, pattern, and often clothing as well, so that full-fed larvæ frequently bear no resemblance, quite apart from size, to those that have just emerged from the eggs.</p>

<p>When a larva is full-fed it wanders about for some time in search of a suitable place for pupation. When it finally comes to rest it spins a silken pad which is grasped by the anal claspers; after an interval of some hours the skin splits open to disclose the immature pupa, which soon shrinks and hardens. The length of the time passed in the pupal stage varies in different species from a few days to many months.</p>

<p>Emergence, or hatching from the pupa, is effected by the splitting of the pupal case along the dorsum. As soon as the butterfly is free it takes up a position which allows the wings to expand. The wings are at first small bags filled with fluid. As they expand, by the blood being pumped through the veins, the two sides of the bag come closer and closer together, and finally fuse everywhere except along the courses of the veins. The wings and other parts of the integument gradually harden, and in an hour or so the butterfly is ready for flight.</p>

<p>Before the change to pupa an internal metamorphosis has begun which continues throughout the pupal life. This involves the breaking-up (<i>histolysis</i>) of all the larval tissues except the mid-gut, tracheal, and nervous systems, and their rebuilding into the imaginal tissues from groups of special cells called <i>imaginal buds</i>.</p>

<p>The final instar is the imago, which differs from all earlier stages in being sexually mature and provided with two pairs of wings. The length of life enjoyed by the imago varies from a few days to over a year. Some butterflies hibernate, or are torpid, during the winter. In captivity certain species can live for at least two years. Our knowledge of the duration of life of the imago is still rather imperfect.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="smallcaps">III. External Morphology.</span> (Figs. 1-8).</p>

<p>1. <i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;The egg consists of the <i>fertilized ovum</i> or female germ-cell enclosed in a shell. It is often called the ovum by entomologists, but this is biologically incorrect. The egg-shell is called the <i>chorion</i>; at the anterior end it is perforated by a tiny opening or group of openings, the <i>micropyle</i>, which is only large enough to admit a single sperm when fertilization takes place. The chorion is either smooth, ribbed or sculptured.</p>

<p>The shape of the egg varies considerably; it may be spherical, cylindrical or domed. In <i>Cyrestis</i> there is a lid which is pushed open by the larva on emergence. The eggs of some Lycænidæ exhibit the most beautiful sculpturing when seen under the microscope. The colour varies from white to green, yellow, orange or red.</p>

<p>The eggs are affixed to the food-plant by means of a sticky secretion. They are laid singly or in clusters.</p>

<p>2. <i>Larva</i> (fig. 1, I. II).&#x2014;The larva or caterpillar is an elongate cylindrical grub with a soft integument, and is composed of 19 segments, of which the first six are fused together and form the head. The head is best treated as a single unit, and is called here the first segment. It is joined to the body by a well-defined neck. The head is hard and <i>sclerotized</i> (<i>i.e.,</i> composed of chitin mixed with other substances), and is furnished with strong biting mandibles, very short antennæ, and normally a set of six separate eyes (<i>ommatidia</i>) on each side, representing the compound eyes of the imago. These larval eyes are often called ocelli, but differ inasmuch as the lens covers only a single eye-element.</p>

<p>The tongue (<i>labium-hypopharynx</i>) arises between the mandibles and the maxillæ. It is a reduced, unpaired organ, and carries the slender, pointed <i>spinneret</i>, from which the secretion of the silk-glands exudes.</p>

<p>The thorax is composed of segments 2, 3, and 4. Segment 2 is the <i>prothorax</i>, 3 the <i>mesothorax</i>, and 4 the <i>metathorax</i>. The prothorax sometimes bears a more or less strongly sclerotized dorsal shield, the <i>prothoracic shield</i>. Each of these segments bears a pair of short legs (the true legs).</p>

<p>The abdomen is composed of ten segments (5 to 14). On segments 7, 8, 9, and 10 are four pairs of short, stumpy, abdominal legs called <i>prolegs</i>. These are furnished with minute hooks (<i>crochets</i>) on the soles (<i>planta</i>). At the end of the last or fourteenth segment are the anal prolegs or <i>claspers</i>. The last segment carries a more or less strongly sclerotized plate called the <i>suranal plate</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>spiracles</i> are located on segments 5 to 12 to the number of eight pairs; there is also a pair on the prothorax. The spiracle is seen on either side of the abdomen as an oval horny area, and a small opening in each leads to the breathing-tubes (<i>tracheæ</i>).</p>

<p>The larva may be smooth, more or less clothed with hair, or provided with bristles or setæ. The arrangement of this vestiture is of taxonomic importance, and is called the <i>chætotaxy</i>. In all <span>Lepidoptera</span> in the first instar there are twelve <i>primary setæ</i> on each segment except the head. Four additional <i>subprimary setæ</i> may appear at the second instar. Each seta is primarily borne on a small papilla, or the seta may proceed from the apex of a small tubercle, called a <i>chalaza</i>. In many butterflies and some moths each originally single seta is replaced after the first instar by a tuft of fine setæ borne on a wart (<i>verruca</i>), or by spiny setæ borne on a strong thorny process (<i>scolus</i>). Some larvæ are furnished with filamentous appendages or tentacles (<i>e.g.,</i> Danaidæ), and others are covered with fleshy tubercles. In the Papilionidæ there is a peculiar organ situated behind the head, consisting of a protrusible tube dividing into two branches; this is called the <i>osmeterium</i>, and it emits a pungent smell, characteristic of the various species.</p>

<p>The coloration and markings of the larva vary considerably. The markings are usually in the form of longitudinal or obliquely-placed stripes. These are described as dorsal, subdorsal, dorso-lateral, lateral, sublateral, dorso-ventral, spiracular, and subspiracular, according to position.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pupa</i> (fig. 1, III).&#x2014;The butterfly pupa is commonly called a chrysalis. It has a hard, usually smooth, rounded and externally solid integument, no mandibles, and the appendages completely soldered down and covered over by external plates. It is usually attached to a silken pad by means of the <i>cremaster</i>. The cremaster, which varies in form in different species and genera, is a specialized process formed from the suranal plate of the larva, and carries numerous minute hooks. The eyes of the pupa are divided into a smooth portion called the <i>glazed eye</i>, and a sculptured portion called the <i>sculptured eye</i>. The second and third abdominal segments are usually free.</p>

<p>The position in which the pupa is placed varies, and is of systematic importance. In the Danaidæ, Satyridæ, Amathusiidæ, Nymphalidæ, and Riodinidæ (Erycinidæ) it is suspended free by the cremaster, head downwards. In the remaining families it is fastened, in addition, by a silken girdle round the middle. In the Papilionidæ and Pieridæ the pupa is placed head upwards. The pupa of <i>Parnassius</i> is enclosed in a slight cocoon placed just below the surface of the ground. In the Hesperiidæ the pupa is enclosed in a cell formed from a leaf. The great majority of butterfly pupæ are attached to leaves, twigs, stems or bark.</p>

<p>The coloration is often dull, but many butterfly pupæ are decorated with metallic gold or silver markings. The pupa may be either smooth or angulate and furnished with spines, and in some groups the wing-cases are sharply projecting.</p>

<p><i>Sex of Pupa.</i>&#x2014;It is usually possible to determine to what sex the pupa belongs. If the ventral part of segments 13 and 14 are examined, certain marks or scars will be seen. The scars of the anal claspers are on segment 14 above the cremaster, and form two slight, narrowly oval protuberances on either side of a short depression. In the ♂ pupa there is a similar but smaller mark on segment 13. In the ♀ pupa, besides the marks described above, the middle anterior portion of segment 14 is produced as a narrow process across segment 13 as far as the middle of 12, and its apical part bears a median depression. In cases where these characters are not easily seen, a single mark on segment 13 and no mark on 12 always indicates a ♂ pupa; a blurring of the segment margins and a mark in the middle of segment 12 always indicates a ♀. The particular segments are easily found by counting down from 9, which is the first broad segment on the ventral side. (See Bell and Scott, 1937, p. 15, figs. 4 C, D).</p>

<p>4. <i>Imago.</i>&#x2014;The body is divided into the head, thorax, and abdomen. The various segments are composed of separate hard pieces of chitin termed <i>sclerites</i>.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Head</i> (fig. 2, I).&#x2014;Small, hairy or scaled. The main dorsal part is called the <i>epicranium</i>, the posterior portion of which is called the <i>occiput</i>, the upper portion the <i>vertex</i>; the anterior portion above the clypeus is the <i>frons</i>. The <i>clypeus</i> (fig. 2, I, <i>c</i>) is a fixed sclerite above the labrum or upper lip, and is well developed in butterflies.</p>

<p>Eyes compound, placed on both sides of the epicranium, and separated. Externally each compound eye consists of a large number of hexagonal <i>corneal lenses</i> formed of transparent chitin; each corneal lens is the outer covering of a single eye-element, or <i>ommatidium</i>, connected at its inner end with a nerve from the optic ganglion. Besides the compound eyes, two simple eyes (<i>ocelli</i>) are often present, situated in a small triangle on the vertex. The ocellus differs from the ommatidium of a compound eye in that its single lens covers a number of internal eye-elements.</p>

<p>The <i>antennæ</i> (fig. 2, II; fig. 3) are segmented, movable appendages placed in sockets and lying more or less between or in front of the compound eyes. Their length varies from a half to three-quarters of the length of the fore wing, sometimes very short in Hesperiidæ. The shaft gradually thickens to a more or less pronounced club at the end, which in some genera is grooved on its lower side. The club usually narrows gradually to the tip, which may be rounded or pointed. In most Hesperiidæ the antennæ are gradually or abruptly bent about the middle of the club, sometimes into a hook (elbowed or <i>geniculate</i>); the club often ends in an abruptly formed point (<i>apiculus</i>). The antennæ are organs of perception and are provided with sensory hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> (fig. 2, I. <i>b</i>; fig. 4) are movable appendages of the labium or lower lip, which in butterflies is reduced to a small basal piece; they usually curve up in front of the face between the eyes. They are composed of three segments, which vary in shape in different groups. There is a short basal segment, a comparatively long middle one, and a narrow terminal one of variable length; the basal and middle segments are densely clothed with scales and often with hairs; the terminal segment may be blunt or pointed and may be placed at an angle with the second segment, inside which it may sometimes be concealed. The palpi may be either erect (against the frons) or porrect (horizontal).</p>

<p><i>Mouth-parts</i> (fig. 2, I, <i>a</i>).&#x2014;Butterflies feed by sucking up plant juices through a long sucking-tube which, when not in use, is coiled up like a watch-spring between the palpi. This tube is a modification of the inner lobes (<i>galea</i>) of the maxillæ; each galea has become elongated, and both are fused together to form the tongue, the inner grooves of the galea forming the cavity of the tube. This organ is often loosely called a proboscis, but is better termed the <i>haustellum</i>.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Thorax</i> (fig. 2, III).&#x2014;Composed of three segments, called the <i>prothorax, mesothorax</i>, and <i>metathorax</i> (fig. 2, III. <i>p</i>) respectively. Each of these bears a pair of segmented legs. The prothorax is small and like a collar; it carries a pair of dorso-lateral processes directed backwards, termed <i>patagia</i> (fig. 2, III). In front of the patagia, behind the head, is the <i>pronotum</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>e</i>), developed as a tufted scale. The mesothorax is large, the metathorax much reduced.</p>

<p>Each thoracic segment is divided into a dorsal plate or <i>tergum</i>, right and left lateral plates or <i>pleura</i>, and a ventral plate or <i>sternum</i>. There are secondary divisions of these. The tergum of the mesothorax has a strongly-built sclerite called the <i>notum</i>, and this has an anterior sclerite called the <i>scutum</i>, with a small posterior sclerite, the <i>scutellum</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>n</i>); the scutum is very large and convex. These sclerites of the mesothorax are, therefore, called the <i>mesonotum</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>g</i>), etc., those of the metathorax the <i>metanotum</i>, etc. On the mesonotum, at the sides anteriorly, are a pair of backwardly-directed shield-like processes called the <i>tegulæ</i> or shoulder-tufts, usually heavily scaled. A pair of spiracles is present in the membrane between the pro- and mesothorax.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Legs</i> (fig. 5).&#x2014;The fore legs arise from the prothorax, the mid-legs from the mesothorax, and the hind legs from the metathorax. Each leg consists of five segments : the <i>coxa</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>i</i>) or hip, the <i>trochanter</i>, the <i>femur</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>k</i>) or thigh, the <i>tibia</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>l</i>) or shank, and the <i>tarsus</i> (fig. 2, III, <i>m</i>) or foot. The coxa is the segment by which the leg is articulated to the thorax; in butterflies it is large and more or less elongate. The trochanter is a very small segment interposed between the coxa and femur. The femur is the strongest part of the leg, usually not very stout, and is shorter than the tibia. The tibia is slender, and of medium length or long; it articulates with the femur by the knee-joint, which is freely movable, and usually rests at a sharp angle to it. The tibia is frequently armed with one or two pairs of movable spurs called the <i>tibial spurs</i> (fig. 5, X); the tibiæ may also be spiny, and sometimes are more or less densely fringed with hair. The tarsus is composed of five segments of variable length, the fifth one ending in a pair of claws, sometimes bifid (fig. 5, VIII), beneath which is a small pad, sometimes absent, called the <i>pulvillus</i>; adjacent to each claw is a brush-like attachment, the <i>paronychium</i>, which is, perhaps, used for cleaning.</p>

<p>The legs furnish characters of considerable taxonomic importance. In some families (fig. 5, II-VI) the fore leg is short, slender, and undeveloped, particularly so in the male, in which the tarsus consists of a short brush, or, in Lycænidæ (fig. 5, IX), of a single claw; the female tarsus in such cases is less hairy, or is simply scaled, and does not bear a claw, the fifth segment being furnished with a few short spines. Most butterflies have a pair of spurs at the distal end of the hind tibiæ; in all Hesperiidæ (fig. 5, X) there is a similar pair of spurs on the mid-tibiæ, and usually a second pair on the hind tibiæ.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Wings.</i>&#x2014;The wings are flattened, membranous expansions, strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs called <i>veins</i> or <i>nervures</i>. The fore wing is attached to the mesothorax, the hind wing to the metathorax. Each wing has been developed as a lateral expansion of the notum to which it belongs. The developing wing-sheath is supplied with a number of tracheæ which arise from two tracheal trunks at its base. The veins are first laid down as pigment bands in the developing wing-sheath, following the courses of the tracheæ. The vein itself is formed as a strong arch of chitin deposited over the channel of the trachea at metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The wings are movably articulated to the sides of the notum. When at rest they are usually held vertically upwards with their upper surfaces pressed close together and their under-surfaces exposed. They can be spread out horizontally, and sometimes the fore wing is brought back to cover a large part of the hind wing.</p>

<p>The shape of the wing is very variable. The upper or anterior margin is called the <i>costa</i> (fig. 7, <i>cm</i>), the posterior edge the <i>inner margin</i> or <i>dorsum</i> (fig. 7, <i>im</i>), the part next to the thorax the <i>base</i> (fig. 7, <i>b</i>); the distal extremity of the costa is called the <i>apex</i> (fig. 7, <i>a</i>), and the similar extremity of the inner margin the <i>tornus</i>; the edge between the apex and tornus is called the <i>outer margin, distal margin</i> or <i>termen</i> (fig. 7, <i>om</i>). On the hind wing the tornal angle is often called the <i>anal angle</i>.</p>

<p>The costa may be straight or highly arched, sometimes concave on the hind wing, and occasionally serrate or minutely saw-toothed on the fore wing. The apex may be rounded, pointed or falcate. The outer margin is usually more or less convex on the hind wing; on the fore wing it is more often straight or even concave, and is often crenulate or dentate. The hind wing is frequently caudate (tailed) at the end of one or more of the veins towards the tornus, which itself is often produced and frequently lobed. Along the outer margin is a regular fringe (the <i>cilia</i>) composed of closely-packed scales in a double row, those of the underside slightly projecting. The inner margin is normally straight, but may be concave or convex.</p>

<p>The wing-membrane is clothed to a greater or less extent, usually entirely, with <i>scales</i>. These scales are minute specialized hairs, and each is inserted in a very minute socket. Each scale usually contains a pigment derived from the blood, and so gives to the wing the colours and markings so characteristic of butterflies. The scales are arranged in regular rows and overlap like tiles on a roof. They are of varied form and sometimes characterize a group of butterflies. They usually bear minute ribs and pits, and in some species they are iridescent, the colour being usually due to the interference of light at the surfaces of extremely delicate laminæ; white is usually produced by reflection or refraction of light by structural elements located in the scale. In the Pieridæ the white colour is produced by a group of pigments called ``pterins.''</p>

<p>In addition to the normal scale described above, scales of another type are often found in the male; these are called <i>plumules, androconia</i> or <i>scent-scales</i> (fig. 6, pp. 14 &amp; 15). They are specialized scales which are connected with a scent-producing gland in the wing-membrance. Such a scale consists of an accessory disc, absent in Lycænidæ, apparently bulbous, connected with a short pedicel or footstalk, from which arises the lamina. The lamina is typically elongate, but may be oblong or rounded, and at the apex is furnished with fimbriæ (plumes), which presumably serve to distribute the odour. These scales present a great variety of form, and are often very useful as an aid in distinguishing genera or species.</p>

<p>The wing-markings are described according to their position. The wing may be divided into a proximal and distal half, the former covering the area between the end of the cell and the base, the latter comprising the remaining outer area. The part around the base of the wing is the basal area, between which and the middle of the cell lies the subbasal area; between the middle and end of the cell is the discal area; between the end of the cell and a point half-way to the outer margin is the post-discal area; between the post-discal area and the margin is the submarginal area, whilst markings placed very near the margin are termed antemarginal. The median area lies along the lower edge of the cell and below it, whilst between this and the inner margin lies the submedian or inner area. The markings are, therefore, described as basal, subbasal, discal, costal, apical, etc. They consist of bands, lines, spots, patches, and rings (eye-spots or ocelli) placed upon a general ground-colour which itself may vary in different parts of the wing. The bands or fasciæ may be solid, macular, or chain-like (<i>catenulate</i>). Lines may be continuous or formed of connected crescents (<i>lunulate</i>). Spots may be of any shape, usually round, triangular or somewhat square. Round spots, bearing one or two pupils, and perhaps surrounded by an iris, are called <i>ocelli</i>. The more exact disposition of the markings is described by reference to their place in respect of the veins. The space between each vein is called an <i>area, interspace</i> or <i>cellule</i>, and these are given numbers, as shown in fig. 7 (p. 16). When no reference is made to these spaces the veins themselves are referred to by name or number.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Wing-venation</i> (fig. 7).&#x2014;In butterflies and moths this is of a characteristic type. It consists of a large <i>cell</i>, called also the <i>discoidal, basal</i> or <i>discal cell</i>, usually closed, with a number of veins radiating from it. A typical butterfly fore wing has twelve veins, the first and last arising from the base, the others from the cell. The hind wing has eight veins, arising in the same way as those of the fore wing. Very often one or more veins are absent, especially on the fore wing.</p>

<p>Different systems of notation are in use to describe the venation. It is convenient to use the numerical notation as being most easily understood, though it takes no account of vein homologies.</p>

<p>Vein 1 is the posterior vein from the base, and two such veins, arising from the base, are typically present in that area, known as veins 1 <i>a</i> and 1 <i>b</i>. Veins 2 to 11 on the fore wing are from the cell, though veins 6 to 9 may be stalked. On the hind wing veins 2 to 7 are from the cell, 6 and 7 being sometimes stalked, and vein 8 is from the base; in Hesperiidæ vein 5 is usually absent. On the fore wing of some butterflies there is a short branch or spur from vein 1 near the base and directed towards the base (based), representing vein 1 <i>a</i>; in addition, in most Papilionidæ, there is a short transverse vein near the base between the cell and vein 1; this is called the <i>median spur</i>; moths possess neither this vein nor the short vein 1 <i>a</i> described above.</p>

<p>On the hind wing near the base of vein 8 there is in most butterflies a short spur projecting from vein 8 towards the costa, being directed either basad or distad, but being some-times almost at right-angles to the costa; this spur is called the <i>precostal</i> or <i>humeral vein</i> and is usually two-branched at the end; strictly speaking, this is a veinlet as distinguished from a vein. In some cases the proximal branch is prolonged to the base of the cell and so forms a small secondary cell called the <i>precostal</i> or <i>basal cell</i>.</p>

<p>Special names have been given to each vein, and as these names often occur in descriptions, it will be useful to explain them here.</p>

<p>On the fore wing vein 12 is known as the 1st Subcostal or the Subcosta, and is often referred to as the Costal Vein; vein 11 is the Radius or 2nd Subcostal; veins 10 to 7 are the Radial Branches 2 to 5, or Subcostals 3 to 6; veins 6 to 4 are the Median Veins or Radials 1 to 3; veins 3 and 2 are the Upper and Lower Cubital Branches, or Medians 1 and 2; veins 1 <i>b</i> and 1 <i>a</i> are respectively the 1st and 2nd Anal and 3rd Anal, or 1st and 2nd Submedians.</p>

<p>On the hind wing vein 8 is the Subcosta or 1st Subcostal, often referred to as the Costal Vein; vein 7 is the Radial Sector or 2nd Subcostal; veins 6 to 4 are the Medians or Radials 1 to 3; veins 3 and 2 are the Upper and Lower Cubital Branches, or 1st and 2nd Medians; vein 1 <i>b</i> is the 1st and 2nd Anal or 1st Submedian; vein 1 <i>a</i> is the 3rd Anal or 2nd Submedian.</p>

<p>The distal end of the large cell is usually closed by three veins between veins 4 and 7; these are most often known as the <i>discocellulars</i>, but are also, perhaps more correctly, termed <i>cross-veins</i>; they are distinguished as upper, middle, and lower. One or more of these veins may be weakly developed on absent; in the latter case the cell is said to be open.</p>

<p>Small <i>veinlets</i> are often found projecting into the cell of the fore wing, and less frequently on the hind wing. Between the veins are found furrows or <i>folds</i> as they are called; these are most strongly developed in areas 1 <i>a</i> to 1 <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>The Table given below will enable the student to understand what veins are meant when consulting a description involving either the Comstock and Needham or the Rothschild and Jordan notations.</p>

<p>Table</p>

<p>(f) <i>Abdomen.</i>&#x2014;This consists of ten segments (fig. 2, III, 1-9); in the female the ninth and tenth are fused together. Each segment consists of a strongly sclerotized dorsal half-ring (the <i>tergite</i>), a somewhat less strongly sclerotized ventral ring (the <i>sternite</i>), and between them a soft membranous <i>pleural region</i> on either side. The sternite of segment 1 is always reduced.</p>

<p>The abdomen is cylindrical or fusiform and completely covered with scales. The anal extremity in the male often bears a short tuft of hairs or of elongate scales. Spiracles are present on segments 1 to 7. Segments 8 to 10 contain the copulatory organs, 9 and 10 being modified. In the male this modification presents a vast variety of form. Such variation is of great value in distinguishing species, and in some cases even groups. This does not always imply, however, that if two insects possess a similar structure they necessarily belong to the same species, though usually they are identical.</p>

<p><i>Male Organs.</i>&#x2014;These will be understood by reference to fig. 8, which is a composite diagram of the genitalia of a butterfly.</p>

<p>The ninth segment is entirely sclerotized, and comprises the tegumen, vinculum, and valve. The <i>tegumen</i> (<i>t</i>) is the dorsal part or tergite. The <i>vinculum</i> (<i>vi</i>) is the sternite, a ventral sclerotized band, often with a posterior prolongation termed the <i>saccus</i> (<i>s</i>). The <i>valve</i> (<i>va</i>), also called clasper, is an enormously developed lateral process, basally articulated to the vinculum; it often bears a process termed the harpe (<i>h</i>), located in the central area. The harpes serve as prehensile organs, and are well developed in Papilionidæ.</p>

<p>The tenth segment is mostly membranous, and is usually concealed within the ninth segment. It bears the uncus, scaphium, and gnathos, and the anal tube passes between the dorsal and ventral parts. Mehta (1933 <i>a</i>) has shown that the tenth segment, in the pupal stages, is visibly distinguished as a tergal and sternal part, the anal tube passing between the two sclerites. The dorsal process is termed the <i>uncus</i> (<i>u</i>) by most authors, although when first distinguished by Gosse (1883) it was meant to indicate a process of the eighth segment, found in <i>Papilio</i>. The uncus is situated above the anus, and is usually fused with the tegumen. It is not well defined in Lycænidæ and Danaidæ.</p>

<p>Attached to the dorsal surface of the anal tube is a sclerotized shield termed by most authors the <i>scaphium</i>. When first distinguished by Gosse (1883) it was meant to indicate the organ described above as the uncus (fig. 8, <i>u</i>). The scaphium is conspicuous in the Papilionidæ and in some <span class="smallcaps">Heterocera</span>.</p>

<p>Arising from the base of the uncus is a pair of hairy pads or lobiform processes which lie on either side of the anal tube. These are termed <i>socii</i>, and are not seen in all groups. In the Lycænidæ they are prominent as long, curved, spine-like processes. Arising from the tegumen on either side, near its apex, is sometimes found a slender, curved, spine-like lobe. This is termed the <i>side lobe</i> (<i>sl</i>), and is prominent in Hesperiidæ; in Lycænidæ the lobes are strongly curved and are usually termed the <i>falces</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>gnathos</i> is a ventral subanal process in the form of a sclerotized arch which is hinged by a membranous base to the ventral side of the tenth segment. It is usually well developed in the Nymphalidæ.</p>

<p>In addition to the processes of the ninth and tenth segments described above, there is the intromittent organ or <i>penis</i> (<i>p</i>), with which are associated the anellus and juxta.</p>

<p>The <i>penis</i> arises from between the bases of the valvæ. It is composed of an outer sclerotized sheath, termed the <i>ædeagus</i> (<i>ae</i>), which encloses a membranous tube, the <i>ductus ejaculatorius</i>; the eversible part of this duct is termed the <i>vesica</i> (<i>ve</i>), and it is sometimes armed with small spines termed <i>cornuti</i> (<i>c</i>) (seen in Nymphalidæ and danaidæ).</p>

<p>The ædeagus is supported, where it enters the body, by a hollow cone-like structure, which may be either strongly sclerotized all round, thus forming a ring, or else sclerotized only ventrally. This structure is ventrally supported by the vinculum, and on either side by the valvæ; it is termed the <i>anellus</i> (<i>an</i>), and is well developed in Nemeobiinæ, Lycænidæ and Hesperiidæ. The sclerotized ventral part of the anellus, forming a sort of shield or plate, is termed the <i>juxta</i> (<i>j</i>); this is well developed in Amathusiidæ.</p>

<p>The fundamental parts of the genital armature are the valvæ, tegumen, vinculum, and penis. Other structures have been evolved at different times, and so no single species exhibits all the structures described above, some being absent or reduced.</p>

<p><i>Female Organs.</i>&#x2014;Segments 9 and 10 are fused together, usually forming a complete chitinous tube with the anal opening at its end, and the opening of the oviduct (through which oviposition takes place) immediately beneath it. This opening has been termed the <i>gonopore</i>. The vaginal orifice is placed in the membrane between segments 7 and 8. This leads by way of a chitinous duct into a large sac, the <i>bursa copulatrix</i>, for holding the sperms; and thence by a tiny <i>seminal duct</i> to a small <i>spermatheca</i>, not always present, and continuing into the common <i>oviduct</i>. This arrangement enables the eggs to be deposited over a long period, the sperms being passed a few at a time into the spermatheca, whence they can reach and fertilize the eggs as they pass down the oviduct. The copulatory aperture lies in a sclerotized area, the <i>genital plate</i>; this is variously modified and is often of taxonomic value.</p>

<p>The fertilized females of <i>Parnassius</i>, and to a less noticeable extent those of <i>Acræa</i>, exhibit a peculiar horny pouch (<i>sphragis</i>) at the end of the abdomen. This is formed by the hardening of a fluid discharged by the male during copulation; the shape of the pouch varies with the species. The females of some species, e.g., <i>Chætoprocta, Tagiades</i> (Hesperiidæ), are furnished with a dense tuft of short hairs at the end of the abdomen, but as a rule there is no hairy tuft in the female.</p>

<p class="section">IV Classification.</p>

<p>Butterflies belong to the order <span class="smallcaps">Lepidoptera</span> or scale-winged insects (<i>lepis</i>, a scale, <i>pteron</i>, a wing). The order is conveniently divided into two main divisions or suborders : (1) <span class="smallcaps">Heterocera</span>, (2) <span class="smallcaps">Rhopalocera</span>. Some authorities distinguish a third division, the <span class="smallcaps">Grypocera</span>, which comprises the Hesperiid{\ae}. The first constitutes the moths, the second the butterflies with clubbed antenn{\ae}, whilst the <span class="smallcaps">Grypocera</span> include the butterflies with hooked antenn{\ae}. These antennal characters are, however, not to be entirely relied upon for distinguishing the divisions.</p>

<p>1. <i>Distinguishing Characters</i>.&#x2014;A butterfly can be always distinguished from a moth by the practised entomologist, but it is sometimes difficult for the amateur to decide. The following summary of the differences, as given by Evans (1932<i>a</i>), will enable the collector to distinguish one from the other after a little practice :&#x2014;</p>

<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Egg usually dome-shaped, upright and sculptured. In moths it is usually rounded or flat, scale-like and reticulate.</li>
    <li>The caterpillar has, in addition to the three pairs of true legs, five pairs (four central, one anal) of prolegs, one or more pairs of which may be absent or reduced in moths. Also in moths the end of the proleg may be triangularly dilated, and the anal pair may be held stretched out behind, with the basal fleshy part often broad and flattened. A butterfly caterpillar very rarely has hairs arranged in tufts or pencils, or dense enough to obscure the surface. Butterfly caterpillars often have spines, branched or simple, but fleshy processes are unusual.</li>
    <li>The chrysalis of a butterfly may hang from a twig, be secured thereto by a girdle, or lie on a leaf or on the ground, or be enclosed in a cell made from a leaf. Moths commonly construct a cocoon for the chrysalis, bury the chrysalis in the ground, or conceal it under bark or in other places.</li>
    <li>Butterflies fly by day and moths by night as a rule, though quite a number of brightly coloured moths are often to seen flying in India by day. Some butterflies remain dormant till dusk, and some prefer the shade to the sun.</li>
    <li>Butterflies sit with the wings erect or spread out flat&#x2014;not, as moths often do, with the wings folded back.</li>
    <li>The butterfly antenna is usually knobbed or hooked at the end, and is never branched or furnished with cilia. The antenn{\ae} are always held straight, either erect or extended in front of the head; they are never curved, twisted, or folded back along the body or concealed under the wings.</li>
    <li>The butterfly eye is usually larger and more prominent than that of the moth.</li>
    <li>The division between the thorax and abdomen is better defined in butterflies, a distinct ``waist'' being formed only in a comparatively few moths.</li>
    <li>In order to ensure rigidity of the wings the base of the hind wing in butterflies is expanded into a shoulder fitting under the fore wing. In moths rigidity is attained as a rule by means of a frenulum or jugum, The <i>frenulum</i> is a stiff bristle ({\male}) or group of hairs ({\female}) at the base of the costa of the hind wing above. This engages in a catch, groove or group of bristles (<i>retinaculum</i>) on the lower surface of the fore wing; some ``Skippers'' are provided with this apparatus in its most elementary form. The <i>jugum</i> is a membranous or spine-like process from the base of the inner margin of the fore wing, passing under the hind wing and holding it between the jugum and fore wing.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>2. <i>Scheme of Classification.</i>&#x2014;The <span class="smallcaps">Rhopalocera</span> are divided into a number of families, arranged by some authorities in three superfamilies. The families are divided into subfamilies, which may contain large groups or tribes. The subfamilies and tribes are made up of genera. The genus consists of one or more distinct species which often form subsidiary groups. Such groups have been called subgenera. The subgeneus is not recognized in the present volume; it is inconvenient and found to be unnecessary, and its use is being discontinued by many entomologists. In place of the subgeneus the term ``species group'' is used, the name of the group being that of the species having the oldest name. The species itself consists of subspecies and forms.</p>

<p>The <i>species</i> is the basis of any scheme of classification. It is not always easy of definition. Where two forms fly together and do not interbreed they are regarded as species, and may be found to have differences in the genitalia. Where two similar forms do not fly together, and there are no important structural differences, they are usually regarded as subspecies of the same species.</p>

<p>A <i>subspecies</i> is a geographical race usually separated from another such race by barriers (horizontal, or vertical in mountain areas) which prevent free and complete interbreeding between the two. In island races interbreeding can rarely occur, but over land areas two races may easily meet and mix along the boundaries of their respective areas.</p>

<p>The term <i>form</i> is used in this volume to denote types of normal variation below the rank of subspecies. The term may be used alone when the nature of the variation is not known. Usually it can be designated, and the following forms may be recognized :&#x2014;Local form, individual form (or aberration), {\male} form, {\female} form, wet-season form, dry-season form.</p>

<p>The term ``variety'' has nowadays no precise meaning, and cannot be regarded as a scientific term.</p>

<p>The various forms may occur everywhere within the range of the species. The local form, so often termed ``variety,'' may be represented in another area as a subspecies, indicating perhaps the persistence or the recurrence of an earlier stage in the history of the species. The sporadic occurrence of a subspecific form outside its special area is compatible with the existence of two distinct races. A subspecies may sometimes be represented by the dry or wet form occurring in another area. These forms are discussed at greater length in the section dealing with variation.</p>

<p>3. <i>Phylogeny.</i>&#x2014;This treats of the presumed origin from previously existing forms, and indicates a view of their supposed genetic relationships. As knowledge increases, ideas on the natural or phylogenetic order of arrangement alter, and numerous systems of classification have been proposed and used since the commencement of the study of entomology.</p>

<p>The system adopted in this volume is the one which has found most favour among Lepidopterists, and is in more general use. When possible, the arrangement of genera and species is the one adopted in the most recent scientific revision. A phylogenetic scheme of arrangement of the families of the Indian <span class="smallcaps">Rhopalocera</span>, corresponding to the system in most general use, is given on p. 53.</p>

<p>4. <i>Nomenclature.</i>&#x2014;Each species is given two names, the first being the name of the genus, the second that of the species. If a species has one or more subspecies the binomial system is expanded to the trinomial. An an example, <i>Papilio machaon machaon</i> Linn{\ae}us is the nominotypical subspecies upon which the species name was founded. <i>Papilio machaon asiatica M\'en\'etries</i> is the subspecies subsequently described from the North-West Himalayas. If no second race is known the name is written in the binomial form, e.g., <i>Papilio crino</i> Fabricius. The species name, other than the generic name, is termed the <i>trivial name</i>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the name of the author (<i>i. e.,</i> the person who first published that name) is placed after the name of the species. This is usually abbreviated to save space, but it should be given in full in the case of a bibliographical reference. Again, the International Rules now demand that no comma be placed between the specific name and that of the author.</p>

<p>When the species or subspecies is referred to a genus different from that in which it was originally located, the author's name is placed in parentheses, e. g., <i>Troides helena darsius</i> (Gray).</p>

<p>A code of international rules, called ``The International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature,'' has been set up by zoologists for the guidance of authors, and for scientific clarity in the use of names. These rules have benn revised from time to time, and in their latest form are published in the `Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington,' vol. xxxix, pp. 75-104, July 30th, 1926. Up to this time few careful studies of the older literature had been made, and while such study is being prosecuted, the application of the rule leads necessarily to some changes of names. This may cause some irritation to those who have been long familiar with a given name, and here is a striking case : <i>Pieris</i> (<i>Anapheis</i>) <i>mesentina</i> (Cramer) has become <i>Anapheis aurota</i> (Fabricius). One has to remember, however, that such changes are for the general good, intended to reduce chaos to order, and making for stability by eliminating confusion. This process will necessarily take some time. The credit for a name must, as a rule, be given to the earliest author. A number of butterfly genera, which would become synonyms by a strict application of the rules, were finally accepted by the International Committee of Zoological Nomenclature as conserved (Rep. Comptes Rend. XII Int. Zool. Congr., Lisbon, vol. i, pp. 181-96, 1936).</p>

<p>When an account is published relating to any previously described species or form, the rules direct that either the date of publication of the name or a full reference to such publication be inserted.</p>

<p>Those who propose to describe new forms must ponder well before coining a name, and unless they are well acquainted with the genus, the bibliography, and the rules, should seek the advice of a specialist. A name which has been used already in the genus will become a <i>homonym</i>, and one used already for the same species will become a <i>synonym</i>; in both cases the names are invalid and cannot be used.</p>

<p>5. <i>Descriptions of New Forms.</i>&#x2014;The method of describing a new species, race or form should follow certain principles. A new name should appear only in a recognized scientific journal; it should be given due prominence in style of type, and should not appear in a footnote. In the case of a race or form, the author of the species or race to which the new name is attached should be given. The sex should be stated, and the description should be as detailed as possible with reference to the presumed nearest allied species or form. In the case of a species, or where the size is obviously different from that of the allied form, the expanse of wing and length of fore wing should be given in millimetres. The number of specimens of each sex should be stated, with their localities, the information under the latter heading being as complete as possible. The locality and sex of the holotype must be clearly stated, as well as its location in a definite museum or collection. Where both sexes are described it is advisable to indicate also the allotype. In the case of a new and obscure species, a description and figure of the {\male} genitalia should be given; in all cases a figure of the imago should be included whenever possible.</p>

<p>Names should not be given to aberrations, teratological (abnormal) examples, or to local forms which show no important differentiation from other forms flying with them, being subject to individual variation. Such names serve only to encumber the literature which, in the case of European butterflies at least, is overburdened with them (<i>cf.</i> the European <i>Parnassius apollo</i> Linn.). A single specimen will often be found to exhibit the characters of several so-called forms. Names given to the forms above mentioned have no recognized status in nomenclature.</p>

<p>6. <i>Types.</i>&#x2014;The specimen which has served for the description, or the specimen selected by the author as representative of a series which has been used for the description, is termed the <i>holotype</i>. This is the chief type, and this alone should be used for comparison; reference thereto is necessary to settle any doubt as to what the name represents. When both sexes are described, the sex which is not marked as ``type,'' or is second in the description, is taken as the {\female} or {\male} <i>allotype</i>, as the case may be. When the opposite sex is described subsequently in another article it is called the <i>neallotype</i>. When other specimens exist of the original series (from which the holotype was selected), these are called <i>paratypes</i>; they were formerly known as ``co-types,'' in cases where no holotype was originally selected. A co-type may be selected subsequently to represent the holotype; such a type is called a <i>genotype</i>.</p>

<p>It is important that all type specimens be provided by the author with a label giving the name and type designation; if possible the sex and year of publication should be added. The word ``Type'' alone on a specimen is not sufficient. Paratypes may all bear labels as such. These are sometimes very useful for exchange or to send to a museum in which the type does not exist. In cases where such paratypes comprise more than one species under a single name, as has frequently been the case, the error will in time be discovered by the specialist. In this way paratypes are unsatisfactory, but are useful if carefully confirmed.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that all holotypes should be placed in national or other large museums where entomology is studied, and elaborate precautions are taken to protect the specimens. The main idea is for general accessibility and preservation.</p>

<p class="section">V. Ecology.</p>

<p>1. <i>Senses.</i>&#x2014;The organs of touch and taste are well developed in most butterflies, sight to a less extent. The eye, although complicated in structure, is not of high efficiency; it perceives a mosaic of indifferent definition at about a range of 2 inches, whilst at 3 feet it sees a mere blur. Experiments seem to show that butterflies are able to distinguish colours, but the ability to do so varies greatly according to the species. Colour can only be distinguished at short range, up to about 50 feet. Unusual movement is perceived at a distance, but whether or not by sight is not certain.</p>

<p>Organs of hearing have not been found in butterflies, though in moths a tympanic organ is often well developed.</p>

<p>The sense of smell is strongly developed, as butterflies are attracted to scented flowers and to a variety of odoriferous substances, whilst repelled by others. The males of many species have scent-producing glands, the odour from which is perceived by the female. Again, the female is able to distinguish the plant upon which to deposit her eggs.</p>

<p>The organs of smell, and probably of touch, are situated in the antenn{\ae}. Four types of sense-organs are found in the antenn{\ae}:&#x2014;(1) A short projection set in a cavity, (2) sensory hairs on the outer surface, (3) a stout, minutely toothed process, (4) a long, pointed bristle. The first and third are used probably for smelling, one for food and the other for the opposite sex. The second and fourth are used probably to sense objects to be avoided. It is well known that a butterfly can fly through a forest at great speed without touching a twig; if deprived of its antenn{\ae} it is unable to find its way about.</p>

<p>A fifth sense-organ exists at the end of the anterior or 3rd segment of the palpus, in the form of a comparatively large pit with a very minute opening; the numerous sensory hairs at the bottom of the pit are carefully protected from direct contact with solids. The function of this organ is unknown.</p>

<p>At the end of the tongue are tiny projections or papill{\ae} which are considered to be organs of taste.</p>

<p>The pulvillus or pad on the last tarsal segment is probably connected with the sense of touch. It is certain that some butterflies can detect sweet substances, for example by means of sense-organs on their feet.</p>

<p>2. <i>Scent-organs.</i>&#x2014;The plumules or scent-scales have been described on p. 13. Other scent-producing organs are found on the wings and bodies of many male butterflies. These consist of brushes, brands or pouches containing specialized scales. Such structures are often associated with a displacement of veins or a distortion of the wing. Besides glands producing odours attractive to the female, there are glands which secrete repulsive odours, serving as a protection against certain enemies.</p>

<p>The following summary of these characters in the various families may be of interest. The greater part is taken from Evans, 1932 <i>a</i>:&#x2014;</p>

<p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><i>Papilionid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;Many species have a fold on the inner margin of the hind wing, and within this fold there is a cottony-looking fluff. Other species have pilose stripes on the fore wing.</li>
    <li><i>Pierid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;The fore wing and sometimes the hind wing are often furnished with plumules. Certain species of <i>Colias, Colotis</i>, and <i>Eurema</i> have sexual brands. Those of the genus <i>Appias</i> have a tuft of hair on either side of the anal segment of the abdomen.</li>
    <li><i>Danaid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;All are furnished with two (in <i>Hestia</i> four) extrusible brushes at the end of the abdomen, and many species have a brand or pouch on the hind wing. Many Eupl{\oe}ines have one or two brands on the fore wing, and often a patch on the hind wing above.</li>
    <li><i>Satyrid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;The greater number of species are furnished with one or more of these organs. Most species of <i>Mycalesis</i> and <i>Elymnias</i> have an erectile tuft of hair overlying a brand on the hind wing above, correlated with a brand on the fore wing below. One <i>Mycalesis</i> has, in addition, a recumbent tuft on the hind wing, others have a tuft overlying a groove on the fore wing above, and one has a brand near the tornus of the hind wing. Many genera (e.g., <i>Pararge, Lethe</i>) have scent-scales on the fore wing. Some <i>Maniola</i> have a peculiar brush within the abdomen, internal to the genitalia, called the <i>Julian organ</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Amathusiid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;Nearly all have these organs. They attain their greatest development in a <i>Zeuxidia</i>; this has four brushes or hair-pencils on the hind wing overlying brands, a brush on either side of the abdomen, and a brand on the underside of the fore wing.</li>
    <li><i>Nymphalid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;Very few possess these organs. Certain <i>Argynnis</i> and <i>Cirrochroa</i> have pilose vein-stripes on the fore wing above, and <i>Ergolis</i> has a large black area of modifed scales on the fore wing beneath.</li>
    <li><i>Riodinid{\ae}(Erycinid{\ae})</i>.&#x2014;This family appears to be devoid of scent-organs in so far as its Indian species are concerned.</li>
    <li><i>Lyc{\ae}nid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;These display a variety of characters. The subfamily Poritiin{\ae} have a tuft on the hind wing; the Gerydin{\ae} a brand or thickened vein on the fore wing. Among the Theclin{\ae} <i>Curetis</i> and <i>Amblypodia</i> have none; some species of the <i>Thecla</i> group have a brand in the cell of the fore wing, and in other genera a brand on the hind wing is correlated with a tuft on the underside of the fore wing, and a patch of modified scales is often found on the fore wing above. The Lyc{\ae}nin{\ae} or ``Blues'' generally possess scent-scales on the fore wing, mostly of battledore-shape, traversed by longitudinal ribs.</li>
    <li><i>Hesperiid{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;Many c{\oe}liadin{\ae} have brands or patches on the fore wing, or streaks of specialized scales along the veins. Some species of Cel{\ae}norrhin{\ae} and Pyrgin{\ae} have a costal fold on the fore wing; most have a pencil of hair on the hind tibi{\ae}, some have an additional pencil on the midtibi{\ae}, and one or two have it on the fore cox{\ae}. An <i>Odontoptilum</i> has tufts at the end of the thoracic scapul{\ae} fitting into grooves on the hind wing. A <i>Carcharodus</i> has a thick tuft of hair on the underside of the fore wing. The Hesperiin{\ae} and Heteropterin{\ae} often have brands as well as patches of modified scales and hair-pencils. <i>Cupitha</i> has a peculiar gland on the hind wing whence a wax-like substance oozes. The genus <i>Ge</i> has a curious circular tuft on the fore wings.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>The nature of the brushes and brands in some Danaid{\ae} has been investigated by Dr. H. Eltringham, F.R.S. The brush consists of a delicate bag, from the inner surface of which arise long hairs or bristles. The bag can be turned inside out, and when thus everted the hairs stand out at right-angles to the surface of the bag. The brushes are impregnated with the scent and distribute it as the butterfly moves through the air. Some species have a small brand on the hind wing. This is a scent-producing organ containing compartments, each closed above by a membrane having a minute orifice in the centre and covered by a special scale. The scent-material doubtless oozes out from the pores and is retained by the cover-scale. The butterfly, in the few cases so far observed, strokes the wing-gland with its brushes and so transfers the scent to them for distribution. The scent is absorbed by a very fine dust formed in the brush-bag, and this dust is scattered by the brushes. In fact, in the words of Dr. Eltringham, ``the apparatus is really an animated powder-puff.'' Not all brush-bearing Danaids produce dust to distribute the scent. In <i>Eupl{\oe}a midamus</i> the scent is produced by glands in the brush-bag itself (<i>cf.</i> Eltringham, 1923).</p>

<p>3. <i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;Every butterfly, upon taking its first flight, seeks food and a mate. Its food consists largely of the nectar from flowers, but many species will feed upon decaying animal matter and excrement. Others are attracted by rotting fruit or the exuding sap of trees. After pairing, the female seeks a plant upon which to deposit her eggs. It seems a mystery how the correct plant is always distinguished, whether it be a low herb, a shrub, a sapling, or the tender top shoots of a tall tree.</p>

<p>The flight of butterflies is as varied as that of birds. The practised collector can often distinguish similar-looking butterflies by their flight. The swift, galloping flight of many Papilios is in striking contrast with the weak, hesitating flight of many Pierid{\ae} and Danaid{\ae}. The characteristic flight of the Hesperiid{\ae} has given to them the cognomen of ``Skippers.'' The flight of butterflies has been discussed by Kheil (1884, p. 12), and his diagrammatic presentation may be worth further investigation.</p>

<p>The resting position of butterflies has been detailed already in sections 3, 4 (<i>d</i>).</p>

<p>The time of day when a butterfly is on the wing varies with the species or group. Most species fly up as soon as the sun has warmed the air; they rest again during the hotter part of the day, and fly again for two or three hours before sunset. Other species are only on the wing for a short time each day, and yet others may be seen at all hours of daylight. Some species, at home among the tree-tops, descend for a short time to suck moisture on the ground, or to feed at flowering shrubs. The sexes are not always found together, the males often congregating with other species, whilst the females fly singly in secluded places in the woods. Owing to these diverse habits it may easily happen that the collector seldom sees the insect, and it is considered as very rare, though in reality it may be common enough at the right time and place.</p>

<p>A peculiar instinct possessed by certain butterflies is that of <i>migration</i>. This has been observed in various parts of India. The available records from Ceylon and South India were summarized by Mr. C. B. Williams (1927). In the Palni Hills 21 species of Papilionid{\ae}, Pierid{\ae}, Danaid{\ae}, and Nymphalid{\ae} were observed to migrate southwards in the autumn, certain Pierid{\ae} (<i>Catopsilia</i> and <i>Appias</i>) northwards in the spring, and a Lyc{\ae}nid (<i>Cosmolyce b{\oe}ticus</i>) north-east, also in the spring. In Ceylon 69 species were found to migrate in the spring and again in the autumn, mostly from the northern part of the island. In North-West India <i>Vanessa cardui</i> and <i>Cosmolyce b{\oe}ticus</i> have frequently been observed migrating in the spring. In general, butterflies are frequently met with proceeding in a certain direction, and they are often observed far out at sea.</p>

<p>4. <i>Enemies</i>.&#x2014;Butterflies are menaced by enemies in all stages of their existence. This counteracted largely by the great number of eggs laid, many more than would otherwise be necessary to carry on the species at normal strength.</p>

<p>In the egg-stage the only protection is concealment and assimilation to the surroundings, whilst small size may be helpful. Cockroaches devour any eggs they find, whilst parasitic Hymenoptera often deposit their eggs in those of the butterfly.</p>

<p>The larva has many enemies, of which the chief are probably birds; but ichneumon-flies, besides other smaller Hymenoptera and Diptera, exact a large toll. The caterpillar may even change to a chrysalis, from which emerge one or more, often many, flies, but no butterfly.</p>

<p>In the imaginal stage the principal enemies are lizards, mantids, spiders, and birds to a minor extent : a lesser toll is exacted by dragonflies and Asilid flies. Most butterflies are well equipped to deal with these enemies&#x2014;a swift, zigzag or turning flight, wing-coloration, and resting position. As the danger of attack is greater when the butterfly is at rest, it has in many cases evolved an underside coloration which more or less harmonizes with its surroundings.</p>

<p>The various protective devices in the larva and imago are dealt with in the section on Mimicry.</p>

<p class="section">VI. Protective Resemblance and Mimicry</p>

<p>The phenomena with which this section is concerned may be grouped under two headings:&#x2014;</p>

<p>(a) Protective Resemblance, covering all cases in which the insect resembles its surroundings, and (b) Mimicry, in which the insect resembles another insect.</p>

<p>The subject is one of the most interesting and at the same time one of the most keenly debated of insect bionomics. It treats of the pattern- and colour-assimilation to the surroundings; also of the similarity of pattern and other likenesses which exist between butterflies of different families and different genera. Any discussion of this subject is inseparable from attempts to explain the phenomena. The Theory of Mimicry endeavours to explain these resemblances and tries to account for various pattern combinations and colour features, including also the development of curious structures and habits.</p>

<p>Whilst no one denies the existence of these resemblances, considerable controversy has arisen over the explanations offered to account for them. The theory usually accepted is based on evolutionary principles; it postulates that the cause of mimicry is selective feeding by birds. The data necessary to support this idea have been very slowly accumulated, and are as yet far too few to convince the sceptic. In spite of this, one cannot say with certainty that birds have not had a large share in directing the evolutionary steps towards the perfection of mimetic resemblances.</p>

<p>Whatever the various factors were which operated in producing protective and mimetic resemblances, they are, like other structures, the result of natural selection.</p>

<p>The subject is one of great complexity, and can here be dealt with but briefly. Reference should be made to the writings of Sir Edward Poulton, F.R.S., our greatest exponent of mimicry, who has given it the status of a science in itself. Many important papers by Poulton, Eltringham, Carpenter, Dixey, and others will be found in the transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Entomological Society of London.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Protective Devices and Resemblances.</i>&#x2014;Besides distasteful juices, a tough integument, and cryptic wing-patterns, many other devices have benn evolved among butterflies to protect them from enemies, not alone in the imaginal, but also in the larval and pupal stages. The larva is frequently coloured to harmonize with its surroundings; it may be armed with spines, or it may possess markings which, together with certain movements, give it ostensibly a terrifying aspect. Some larv{\ae} can eject a distasteful fluid to the discomfiture of an enemy. Others are brightly coloured, and feed by day exposed to view; these are possessed of distasteful qualities and exhibit warning patterns, as do the imagines. Contrasted with these are the palatable larv{\ae}, which hide during the day and feed only at night; some of these are rendered inconspicuous by resembling flowers and other plant-structures, birds' droppings, etc. The larv{\ae} of certain Lyc{\ae}nids are protected by their association with ants. Such larv{\ae} possess ``honey-glands,'' which exude a nectar of which the ants are very fond. In some cases the larva, when nearly full-grown, is carried by the ants to their nest, where it is tended by them until it pupates, emerging as a butterfly direct from the nest.</p>

<p>In the pupal stage still greater protection is attained. The pupa is usually concealed by its coloration and shape, and is further protected by its hard case and sheltered position. The pup{\ae} of some Papilionid{\ae} resemble pieces of broken-off twigs, and others are flattened and coloured to resemble the stone or rock to which they are attached. The pup{\ae} of some species, <i>e.g.,</i> the Hesperiid <i>Gangara thyrsis</i>, are able to make a rattling and hissing noise when disturbed.</p>

<p>In the imaginal stage we find other protective devices besides warning colours and cryptic coloration. Many Lyc{\ae}nids have tails, with eye-spots at their bases, in the anal part of the hind wing. When the wings are closed this part is deceptively like a head with antenn{\ae}; an enemy seizing this ``false head'' secures only a mouthful of hind wing, and the insect flies off again. Many species, when resting in the sun, orientate themselves so that they do not cast a conspicuous shadow. Such action may be heliotropic; in nay case the insect does not make the movement on purpose.</p>

<p>The mode of flight of many mimetic butterflies resembles the flight of the model. This is noticeably the case with some Papilios (<i>Chilasa</i>), but these have also retained the original Papilionid flight and, when danger definitely threatens, resort to this rapid flight to escape. The element of surprise in effecting a quick change, whether of flight or pattern, is often successful in deluding a pursuer. This again is well shown in the case of the Leaf-butterfly (<i>Kallima</i>), well known in India as the most striking instance of cryptic coloration.</p>

<p>Some species of <i>Kallima</i> exhibit great variability in their resemblance to dead leaves, all shades of brown and dark green and all types of leaf-marking being represented on the underside. The upperside of the fore wing is usually adorned with band of bright colour, rendering the butterfly a conspicuous object in flight. This serves to make the discomfiture of the enemy more complete when the insect comes suddenly to rest, protected by its leaf-like underside.</p>

<p>There is as yet, perhaps, no observation on record of a bird having been seen chasing a <i>Kallima</i>. They appear to be attacked, probably by lizards, as many specimens in collections have damaged hind wings. There is, of course, no evidence to show how the group was persecuted in the past, but to suppose that it suffered considerably is the only satisfactory explanation of this strange combination of cryptic coloration and bright colours.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Mimicry</i>.&#x2014;Two explanations are generally accepted to account for the mimetic patterns. The first was propounded by H. W. Bates in 1861 as the outcome of his observations on butterflies in Tropical South America. He submitted that one group, much more numerous in individuals, and possessing distasteful qualities, acted as the model for another group, less numerous, and not possessed of defensive qualities. The first group exhibited striking patterns and colours allied with distasteful qualities; such colour-patterns were termed ``Warning Coloration.'' This is known as <i>Batesian Mimicry</i>; it is less frequent than a second kind, the explanation of which was offered by F. M\dd{u}ller in 1879, from this observations on butterflies in South Brazil. He found that different species of distasteful butterflies mimicked each other, and explained how the loss from enemy attack would be greatly lessened by pattern associations among distasteful species. This is called <i>M\dd{u}llerian Mimicry</i>.</p>

<p>These two basic hypotheses do not explain how a sufficiently definite initial likeness came to be developed before it could prove of selective value&#x2014;a very general difficulty in all evolutionary problems&#x2014;nor how the many degrees of distastefulness were obstacles to survival of pattern, nor how the intrusion of other factors have aided or retarded the mimetic development. The student should consult the authorities mentioned above who have dealt with these questions.</p>

<p>Mimicry involves no conscious action on the part of the insects themselves, as is sometimes thought by those unfamiliar with the subject.</p>

<p><i>Models.</i>&#x2014;The butterflies which act as models for mimicking species must possess qualities which render them distasteful to enemies, also they must be very common&#x2014;on the whole more common than the mimicking species. They must possess a well-defined pattern. The addition of a striking coloration will also aid in protection, warning the enemy to leave them alone. The various types of Warning Coloration are found primarily in models.</p>

<p>Among the butterflies of the Indian region the Danaid{\ae} are the models for most mimetic species. The subfamily Danain{\ae} are all of striking coloration, with black and white, or yellow or greenish stripes and markings. In the subfamily Eupl{\oe}in{\ae} are many with white spots or patches upon a brown or black ground, and others with the wings shot with blue or purple. They are slow fliers and are very tenacious of life.</p>

<p>The larv{\ae} of Danaids feed upon species of Asclepiadace{\ae}, which re believed to contain poisonous substances; in one species at least a poisonous constituent has been found to be present as a complex organic acid.</p>

<p>Another group of models is found in the genus <i>Polydorus</i>, a section of Papilionid{\ae}, whose larv{\ae} feed upon species of <i>Aristolochia</i>. These plants, or at least some of them, emit repulsive odours and contain poisonous alkaloids.</p>

<p>Another group of models is provided by the genus <i>Delias</i>, most of which have brightly coloured undersides. Their larv{\ae} all feed upon species of Loranthace{\ae} (mistletoe). Little is known of the chemical constituents of these plants, but at least one species has been found to contain a powerful narcotic. The powdered dry leaves of <i>Viscum monoicum</i> are used in Calcutta as a substitute for strychnine and brucine.</p>

<p>It seems very probable, as suggested by Corbet and Pendlebury (1934) and others, that the organic poisons absorbed by the larva from its food-plant can be retained in an active form through the pupal stage to the imago. Here is a field for instructive chemical research.</p>

<p><i>Mimics.</i>&#x2014;The mimicking species may be either palatable or distasteful to enemies, and may be either as common as or rarer than their models. They usually belong to groups which exhibit considerable variation. Generally speaking, the mimic is palatable, with feeble means of protection, and is less numerous than the model. In many cases the {\female} is the mimic, whilst the {\male} may either resemble another model or differ altogether in pattern. Other species may mimic the same model in both sexes. Many mimics have the underside of the wings cryptically coloured, so that they harmonize with their surroundings when at rest, and are either comparatively invisible to an enemy or can be mistaken for a leaf or other object as the case may be. The model has no need of this additional cryptic protection, and has usually an underside pattern almost as striking as that of the upperside, being even adorned in many cases with some additional brightly coloured marking. Such markings are sometimes copied by the mimic, especially when cryptic colouring is not developed.</p>

<p>Models and mimics usually will be found to occupy the same faunistic area, and to fly together. Where the model gives rise to geographical races, the mimic is found to vary in the same way. As a general rule the mimic is not found beyond the geographical range of the model; but there are some notable exceptions, as, for example, the forms of <i>Valeria</i>, which resemble Danaids that do not fly in the same area. This case is explained on the grounds that their chief enemy is a migratory species of Wagtail (<i>Rosa</i>, 1937).</p>

<p>The phenomena of mimicry are still far from being perfectly understood, and a wide field for research into its causes still exists. Butterflies should be watched as closely as birds, and naturalists who do not wish to collect them may obtain much valuable data by patient watching and compiling notes <i>on the spot</i>. Any records, especially of attacks by birds, or specimens which bear clear marks of attack, will be welcomed by the Hope Professor of Entomology, University Museum, Oxford.</p>

<p>Following are a few of the more outstanding examples of mimicry in India. But it should also be mentioned that among the large family of the Nymphalids there exists a great deal of intergeneric resemblance, probably of protective value; certain pattern associations are formed, usually black and white or black and brown, e.g., <i>Limenitis, Parathyma, Neptis.</i></p>

<p class="section">VII. Variation.</p>

<p>The perfect butterfly is subject to individual, sexual, seasonal, and geographical variation to a remarkable extent. Species differ in the degree of variability of the wing-pattern, some species being more stable than others.</p>

<p>The sexes of most butterflies differ to a greater or less degree, either in pattern or colour or both. When the sexes differ in appearance the species is said to exhibit <i>sexual dimorphism</i>; when either sex exhibits two different forms that sex is said to be <i>dimorphic</i>; when more than two forms occur the species is said to be <i>polymorphic</i>. The best known examples of polymorphism among Indian butterflies are the females of <i>Papilio polytes</i> and of <i>Papilio memnon</i>, which are trimorphic in certain areas. <i>Chilasa clytia</i> and <i>C. paradoxus</i> are dimorphic in both sexes. The female of <i>Euripus halitherses</i> is definitely dimorphic, and each form is rather variable.</p>

<p>Seasonal variation is most marked in certain Indian butterflies, particularly in the areas affected by the South-West Monsoon. It is doubtless due in part to the effect of the climate on the larva and pupa, and in part to the very different state, at different seasons, of the vegetation upon which the larva feeds. In some species it seems likely that the characteristic has been inherited from ages past, and persists though the original causes have disappeared. This may account for ``dry'' or ``wet'' forms occurring simultaneously, or even in the opposite type of season, and in countries like Malaya, where there is little or no seasonal change. Microclimatic conditions seem also to play a part in the production of these forms.</p>

<p>In the Himalayas most butterflies have two broods, the spring and summer ones, and these show more or less marked differences; <i>Polygonia egea</i> is a good example. In the rest of India butterflies are on the wing all the year round, since life is never completely dormant as it is in the Himalayan winter. In some species. as in <i>Eurema</i> for example, brood succeeds brood and the extreme dry- and wet-season forms, though very different in appearance, can be connected by a series of intermediate variations. In many species there are two sharply differentiated broods, striking examples occurring in Satyrid{\ae} (e.g., <i>Melanitis, Mycalesis</i>), in which the underside of the dry-season form resembles a dead leaf, whilst that of the wet-season form shows conspicuous ocelli and striated or freckled markings.</p>

<p>Two other, and less common, types of variation occur in all families of butterflies. One of these is heritable whilst the other is rarely so. The first may be regarded as a ``sport,'' but more truly as an <i>individual form</i>. It may exist as a colour change, certain markings may have increased or disappeared, or a new pattern-character may be observed. The other type is called an <i>aberration</i>, and represents some derangement or upset of the organism; with it are classed specimens with a duplication or absence of organs (<i>teratological</i>), which are not known to be, or are rarely, inherited. It is often difficult to know to which type a certain variation belongs. The individual form is much more common than the aberration. As examples of the latter can be cited two unusually striking aberrations of <i>Papilio polytes</i>. These received the names, as distinct species, of <i>sakontala</i> Hew. and <i>walkeri</i> Jans. As examples of the individual form can be cited <i>Chilasa clytia</i> f. <i>dissimilis</i>, with forms <i>janus, papone,</i> etc.</p>

<p>Another, and still rarer, type of variation is the <i>gynandromorph</i>, the insect being partly male and partly female. Similar to these are the <i>somatic mosaics</i>, in which certain areas of the wings are marked as in the opposite sex, whilst the body-structure is of one sex only.</p>

<p>There remain to be considered the hybrids between different species. These are believed to be very rare in nature, and no specimen should be accepted as a hybrid in the absence of conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>Individual variation, when extended and reproduced over a certain area, leads to the formation of geographical races, and these may ultimately become so distinct as to be ranked as species. Such variation is to be observed in species confined to forest areas, in those separated from each other by impassable deserts, by cultivated areas, high mountains, broad rivers, or the sea. A very instructive account of how such races may be produced is given by Evans (1932 <i>a</i>), and may profitably be cited here:&#x2014;</p>

<p>``So long as conditions are suitable a species will extend its sphere to the possible limits. Gradually conditions change and the sphere occupied by a species may become divided into areas separated from one another by zones where the butterfly cannot exist. The climate and vegetation of one of the separated areas may change, and the butterfly will also change, either by bounds or little by little conformably with changes in the area, so that its appearance, structure or habits diverge more and more from the original form. Further changes may cause the separated area to become once more united with an area where the original species still exists, though probably in a modified form. The two forms of what were the same species may find that they are able to interbreed freely, when either one form will completely swamp the other; or there may remain a neutral area on either side of which one form is dominant; or they may carry on as dimorphs. The two forms may find interbreeding impossible and must then be regarded as constituting two independent species, and will always remain so, though they will develop on parallel lines and may in course of time resemble one another exactly and inhabit identical areas.''</p>

<p>As an example of this geographical variation in India, Evans (1932 <i>a</i>) writes as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p>``<i>Papilio memnon</i> affords an interesting study. It flies from Sikkim to Malaysia; the {\male} is more or less uniformly dark and tailless; there are three quite distinct forms of female, one of which is tailed and looks quite different from the male. In South India, and in a slightly modified form in Ceylon, there flies a closely allied species, <i>Papilio polymnestor</i>, which is tailless, has the sexes nearly alike, differing from the male of <i>memnon</i> in having a broad blue band above. The two species meet in the lowlands of Sikkim, whence aberrations (variations) of <i>memnon</i> have been obtained showing a resemblance to <i>polymnestor</i>. The inference is that they can interbreed, probably with difficulty, but each retains its dominance in its own area and their border line is probably defined by the change in food-plant, preventing penetration into each other's areas. In the Andamans there flies the closely allied <i>P. mayo</i>, which has a male resembling <i>polymnestor</i> and an entirely different female resembling the tailed female of <i>memnon</i>.''</p>

<p>In some species variation in wing-pattern is relatively slight, and no geographical race has been developed. Such a species is said to be fixed, but there is nothing to show that it may not produce a new form at some future time. Other species resemble one another so closely in pattern that they were formerly classed as a single one. Structural characteristics, as in the genitalia, alone may have led to their separation, the considerable morphological differentiation being obscured by external similarities. Striking examples of this phenomenon are found among the Hesperiid{\ae} and to a still greater extent among moths; other examples occur in the Satyrid{\ae} (<i>Mycalesis</i>) and Lyc{\ae}nid{\ae} (<i>Tarucus</i>). Evans notes that a single <i>Zizyphus</i> bush may harbour a crowd of the little spotted <i>Tarucus</i> butterflies, consisting of as many as three distinct species, all superficially indistinguishable.</p>

<p class="section">VIII. Distribution.</p>

<p>The world is divided by zoologists into five faunistic regions, each of which has in the aggregate a special type of butterfly fauna. Each region is divided and subdivided into faunistic areas, each also with its peculiar types of species:&#x2014;</p>

<p>
  <ol type="I">
    <li><i>Pal{\ae}arctic Region.</i>&#x2014;This comprises all Europe, extending from Africa north of the Sahara (including Madeira, Canary Islands, and the Azores), and eastwards, embracing Western, Central (north of the Himalayas), and Northern Asia, Japan, and neighbouring islands. It may be regarded as forming a part of a Holarctic Region, in which is also included the North American or Nearctic Region.</li>
    <li><i>Oriental Region.</i>&#x2014;This comprises India proper, east of the hills bordering the North-West Frontier and south of the Himalayas, Burma, Southern China, Formosa, Hainan, and extending southwards to include the Philippines, Celebes, Flores, Java, and Sumatra.</li>
    <li><i>Australasian Region.</i>&#x2014;This comprises the Moluccas, New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands.</li>
    <li><i>Aethiopian Region.</i>&#x2014;This comprises Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Comoro, and other adjacent islands.</li>
    <li><i>South American</i> or <i>Neotropical Region.</i>&#x2014;This comprises South and Central Americal and the southern part of North America.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>The faunas of all these regions have affinities with each other, sometimes possessing identical genera and species. We are here concerned mainly with the first two. A certain African infiltration is found in the western part of the Indian area.</p>

<p>The political boundaries of India in the north and west coincide very generally with the northern boundary of the Oriental and the southern boundary of the Pal{\ae}arctic areas in the region dealt with in this volume. This region has been divided into eight areas by Evans, who has prepared the following table specially for this Introduction.</p>

<p class="family-heading">1. <i>The Areas considered.</i></p>

<p><i>Ceylon</i> is closely allied to South India and has a number of peculiar forms, some of which are related to those of the Malaysian Subregion.</p>

<p><i>Peninsular India</i>, in its southern part, is geologically a very old country, with some endemic species found nowhere else. Generally speaking, the butterflies are nearly allied to those of the Malaysian Subregion. The hills are the habitat of two or three Pal{\ae}arctic species.</p>

<p><i>Caluchistan</i> is mainly Pal{\ae}arctic, and has affinities with Persia.</p>

<p><i>Chitral</i> is in the main a part of the Central Asian section of the Pal{\ae}arctic Region, with a strong infiltration from the Himalayas.</p>

<p>The <i>West Himalayas</i> are in part Pal{\ae}arctic, particularly the inner ranges, and part Oriental, due to infiltration from the South and North-East India divisions.</p>

<p><i>North-East India</i> is one of the most interesting and richest areas in the world. The Central Asian and Chinese divisions of the Pal{\ae}arctic Region here meet the South Indian and Malaysian divisions of the Oriental Region. It constitutes a portion of the Indo-Chinese Subregion of the Oriental Region. Faunal boundaries are principally a question of altitude.</p>

<p><i>Burma</i> has affinites with Assam, South China, Tong-king, and Siam on the one hand, and with Malaya on the other. The accepted border between the Indo-Chinese and Malaysian Subregions runs through Victoria Point. The fauna is very rich, and many of the species are still very rare in collections.</p>

<p>The <i>Andaman Islands</i> show a close relation to the Indo-Chinese Subregion, though many of the forms are much modified.</p>

<p>The <i>Nicobar Islands are to be included in the Malaysian Subregion, exhibiting a close affinity with Sumatra. The forms are mostly modified, with races in North, Central, and South Nicobars.</i></p>

<p class="family-heading">2. <i>Distribution of Species in India.</i></p>

<p>The table below shows how the species in the various families are distributed between the eight areas. The figures are from Evans (1932 <i>a</i>), with slight alteration:&#x2014;</p>

<p>Before the volumes on butterflies are completed there will be doubtless some alteration in the data given in this table, but the proportional specific representation is unlikely to be changed to any appreciable extent for any one area.</p>

<p class="section">IX. Collecting and Preserving. (Fig. 9).</p>

<p>1. <i>Collecting.</i>&#x2014;The first requisite is a net. The Kite or Ballon net, sold by most dealers in entomological requisites, is very useful, as it can be taken to pieces and put together again very quickly. The main support is a brass ``Y'' into which are fitted the cane frame and the handle. If such a brass ``Y'' is obtained one can make the net by bending a piece of cane for the frame and cutting a strong stick for the handle. The bag may be of strong mosquito-netting, and should be dyed green, brown or black, as white is apt to alarm some butterflies. The bag must be rounded at the bottom. There is another kind of net that is also very useful : this has an all-metal frame which folds together, and at the stick end is a ferrule arrangement to tighten up the frame, and into which the stick is inserted. This net has the advantage of greater reliability, as the frame of the Kite net is apt to break under a particularly strong sweep, and nothing is more annoying than to find one's net become suddenly useless when pursuing a specially desirable specimen. Nevertheless it is sometimes an advantage to possess a few Kite nets when employing native collectors.</p>

<p>To catch the insect in flight, make a rapid side-stroke; an insect at rest is best secured by a downward stroke. The bag should be at once twisted over the frame to prevent the insect from escaping, and then the butterfly must be killed. Get the insect into a fold of the net with its wings closed and then pinch the underside of the thorax. In the great majority of cases a light pinch is sufficient, but for a Danaid or <i>Parnassius</i>  a much harder pinch is necessary. There are many butterflies (Lyc{\ae}nids, Hesperiids, most Satyrids, etc.) which should advisably not be killed in this way; either damage to the fore legs or thorax or scales rubbed off the wings may be the result. The use of a killing-bottle is recommended for these insects. The use of a killing-bottle is recommended for these insects. This consists of a stout glass tube, fitted with a cork or rubber bung. At the bottom of the tube place a layer of potassium cyanide crystals and press it down; over this place a layer of dry plaster of Paris and press this down; three or four thicknesses of blotting-paper are now cut to size and laid upon the plaster, followed by a small wad of cotton-wool; a further three or four thicknesses of blotting-paper should be pressed down upon the wool. Not more than a quarter of the tube should be occupied by the killing agent and packing. Such a tube will remain dry for a long time, and after a while the moisture in the cyanide will cause the plaster to set and harden. As soon as the insect is dead it should be removed from the tube. Should it be desired to kill larger specimens by means of cyanide, a wide-mouthed glass jar must be prepared. A layer of cyanide crystals is placed at the bottom, and these are covered with a paste of plaster of Paris to a depth of about half an inch. When the plaster has set, it should be covered with several sheets of blotting-paper cut to size; when this becomes wet it must be removed, and either consigned to the fire or buried out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Another useful killing agent is carbon tetrachloride. As this is a liquid, some sort of absorbent pad must be provided. A wad of felt, or a piece of spongy rubber, secured at the bottom of the tube and covered with a few thicknesses of blotting-paper, will serve the purpose. This should be made damp, but not wet, with the liquid, drops of which can be added when necessary. For this purpose the tetrachloride can be carried in one of the brass chloroform bottles sold by the dealers. The liquid is extremely volatile, and an air-space must be left in the bottle containing it. If the vapour be inhaled it is liable to cause a headache. The vapour kills rapidly, and it is advisable to place the killing-tube against the outside of the net so as to quieten an insect, which can then easily be transferred to the tube. It is not known to change the colour of specimens, as is often the case with many Pierids subjected to cyanide.</p>

<p>After killing, the collector can adopt one of two courses. The insect may be either transferred to a paper envelope or pinned in a cork-lined collecting-box; all handling should be done with a pair of plain blunt entomological forceps. When the insect is transferred to an envelope the wings are closed over the back, with the antenn{\ae} between them or against the costal margins. It is important to place only <i>one</i> butterfly in an envelope.</p>

<p>The envelopes, or ``papers'' as they are called, should be made of some fairly smooth paper, not too thick nor too thin. Very smooth paper should be avoided, as the insect is apt to slide about when the papers are handled or a parcel is in course of transport. Transparent paper, often sold by the dealers, is also not to be recommended. In the absence of special paper, old magazines and certain newspapers may be used. The triangular envelopes are made by cutting out rectangular pieces of paper, and three useful sizes are 3 in. &#xd7; 4 in., 4 in. &#xd7; 5&#x00BD;  in., 5 in. &#xd7; 7 in. The method of folding the paper is shown in fig. 9 (1). The paper is folded along the diagonal AB so that the edge BC lies along the line BD. The flaps E and F are now folded over on each side. The completed envelope is shown in fig. 9 (2). The projecting edges of the flaps may be turned over or cut off. Note the position in which the butterfly is placed in the envelope. The flaps should not be gummed down, and the folds must be pressed flat before the envelope is ready for use. A quick and easy method is to pass the papers through a mangle or wringer; otherwise keep them under pressure for at least 24 hours. It is an advantage to use plain paper, as one can write the data upon it.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p>A supply of envelopes of different sizes should be carried in a pocket-box, and as they are filled they should be transferred to another box.</p>

<p>Upon arrival home it is advisable to place the envelopes containing specimens for a short time in a killing-jar, or in a box containing cyanide or tetrachloride, to make sure that life is extinct and to ensure the destruction of all parasites; otherwise many Danaids and <i>Parnassius</i>, for example, will be found to have recovered, and even after several days may fly off when the envelope is opened.</p>

<p>Papered butterflies should be stored in a box (preferably of wood) fitted with a good lid and having plenty of powdered naphthalene at the bottom. If the specimens are to remain in the box for some months or more it may be advisable to coat the bottom of the box with a solution of naphthalene in chloroform and phenol. This will prevent mildew, as well as keep away pests. Such a wooden box should be enclosed in a tin one as a further protection against pests. Before the papered insects are packed they should be laid out to dry thoroughly; if packed when fresh they may become mildewed, especially in a tin. It is of course easier to pack a fresh specimen, and more envelopes can be pressed into the box without harm; but they must not remain thus packed for any length of time.</p>

<p>When the day's collecting is over it is advisable to go through the specimens, and in the case of Lyc{\ae}nids and Hesperiids, and in others where the sexes are not known, to squeeze the abdomen gently with tweezers so as to extrude the genitalia; in some cases a pin can be inserted near the apex of the ventral surface and the genital structures be pushed out. This will facilitate the determination of sex and of obscure species. Care should be taken to see that the body is sufficiently relaxed to permit such manipulation; in dry weather it is advisable to perform the operation in the field.</p>

<p>An important adjunct to the collector's outfit is a supply of bait which will attract many butterflies that otherwise are not often seen and are sometimes rare. The best bait is overripe or rotting bananas, pineapples, etc., as well as rotting meat of any kind. The fruit should be crushed, enclosed in large leaves, and suspended from low bushes in tall forest. These baits should be inspected in the late afternoon and early morning, and perhaps at midday. After heavy rain they must be renewed.</p>

<p>Whenever the collector comes across a butterfly new to him he should catch a good series, however common it may appear to be. Certain examples of some rarities in our museums still remain as samples taken because they were thought to be common and easily obtained species.</p>

<p>Another branch of collecting is concerned with larv{\ae} and pup{\ae}. Too little is known of these earlier stages, and every endeavour should be made to collect and breed them. If the rearing of larv{\ae} is accompanied by full data as to food-plant, times between and number of moults, and descriptions or drawings at each stage, important advances in our knowledge may be made. The caterpillars should be placed in airy cages covered with mosquito-netting, furnished with fresh food from the known plant, and kept very clean. When the larv{\ae} are full-fed some sticks, preferably from the food-plant, should be cut and placed in a sloping position in the cage. The larve will pupate upon these, and when the imago emerges it will climb up them to dry and expand its wings. The cages must be isolated from ants, being furnished with short legs which are placed in small vessels containing water with a little paraffin or creosote; or they may be suspended by wire or string which has been soaked with these strong-smelling liquids.</p>

<p>Where it is possible to breed a complete family from the eggs it is often worth while to keep all the resulting imagines in one series, and if the species be variable, and the parents are known and included, such a bred family becomes of much scientific interest, and may prove of considerable value in the study of genetics and variation. Any such bred families should be sent to the Hope Professor at the Hope Department of Entomology, University Museum, Oxford; here, in due course, they will become the subject of expert study.</p>

<p>2. <i>Preserving</i>.&#x2014;Before the butterfly is ready to be placed in the collection the wings must be spread out, also the antenn{\ae}, and perhaps the legs. For this purpose the specimen must be relaxed, unless it is still fresh and limp. Relaxing can be done in a tin with a good lid, or in a shallow glass vessel fitted with a lid or covered by a glass plate. A layer of damp sand, damp blotting-paper, or a large plug of damp cotton-wool is placed in the receptacle. Papered specimens can be placed on the damp surface, but loose ones must be laid on a dry sheet of paper. Precautions against mould must be taken, and the damp sand or papers should be changed frequently. It is not advisable to introduce carbolic acid as a preventative, but some crystals of thymol will be effective and are also harmless to the specimens. The time taken to relax varies. After a few hours the specimens may be picked up with the forceps and the underpart of the thorax gently squeezed. If the wings are readily movable, and can be pressed open easily with the forceps placed against the bases of the wings, the insects are ready for setting.</p>

<p>Another method of relaxing which has been recommended (Sevastopulo, 1936, J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxviii, pp. 634-6) is to damp the papers and contents with methylated spirit and shut them up in an air-tight tin for two days. Specimens so relaxed can be removed from the setting-board after 24 hours. Care must be taken to see that the papers do not bear writing in ink or copying-pencil, as the spirit will affect it.</p>

<p>When the insects are properly relaxed they are first pinned into the groove of a setting-board of suitable width, the wings being spread out with the aid of a setting-needle and secured with tracing-linen or paper strips. There is not space here to give an adequate description of the method of setting. This is best shown by an expert in this operation, of which excellent accounts are given by Evans (1932 <i>a</i>) and by Corbet and Pendlebury (1934).</p>

<p>The boards with specimens must be placed in a ventilated box securely isolated from ants. When the abdomen is stiff and hard the insects must remain on the board for another 24 hours. In the case of butterflies which have been kept dry in papers for some time they should remain on the boards for at least two weeks. Specimens may of course be dried before a fire or placed in an oven with a gentle heat. An hour or so will suffice, but the insects must still remain <i>in situ</i> for several hours longer, or the wings are liable to spring upwards more or less after removal from the board.</p>

<p>The store-box or drawer to contain the specimens will be of a depth suited to the length of pin. If long pins are used for mounting, a store-box should be corked on one side only. It is preferable to use long pins of rustless steel; the specimen can be handled more easily, and there is more room for labels.</p>

<p>To guard against pests the most efficient substance is para-dichlorobenzene in crystals. This will kill anything introduced into the box, including the larv{\ae} of museum beetles. In very damp climates it is as well to keep the store-boxes in a zinc-lined drying case fitted with calcium chloride dryers.</p>

<p>When set specimens ``spring,'' <i>i.e.,</i> when the wings move from the set position, as they often do in damp climates, the specimen should be reset and a little viscous shellac (prepared by dissolving shellac in alcohol) applied to the base of the wings below.</p>

<p>Besides shellac for re-fixing the abdomen in some cases, another useful cement may be made by dissolving celluloid in amyl acetate. One can use discarded photographic films, which are stripped of gelatine and cut up into very small pieces. This cement is of value in fixing antenn{\ae}, wings, and pieces of damaged wing.</p>

<p>Gum may be required for labels and for mounting dry dissections. The following formula given by Tillyard (1926) is for a gum that will not become brittle in hot, dry weather, and will not form mould under damp conditions :&#x2014;Gum arabic (60 parts); sugar (30 parts); carbolic acid (2 parts); alcohol at 95 per cent. (8 parts); water (45 parts).</p>

<p>3. <i>Preparation of Genitalia.</i>&#x2014;For the benefit of those who wish to study these structures (and an examination of them is often necessary in the case of obscure species) a general account of the method to be adopted is given below.</p>

<p>It has been stated already, in the section dealing with collecting, that the genitalia can be squeezed out whilst the specimen is fresh. In this case the parts can usually be seen clearly at any time with the aid of a pocket lens. On the other hand, where the parts are not visible, proceed as follows :&#x2014;</p>

<p>The end of the abdomen is wetted with wood-naphtha, which will relax the parts; after removing one clasper apply the spirit to the inner cavity; only a minute or two is necessary for all Hesperiids and the larger Lyc{\ae}nids. Having thus relaxed the parts the insect, or the detached abdomen, must be placed under suitable magnification whilst dissection is carried out. Use a pair of fine-pointed forceps and a needle which has been ground down to three cutting-edges. The parts are kept in a relaxed condition by frequent applications of wood-naphtha, using a small paint-brush. One or both claspers may be detached, and afterwards the uncus with tegumen and vinculum, and claspers separately, are mounted on a card fastened to the pin which carries the insect. The clasper should be mounted to show the inside, and the uncus upright. Some practice will be necessary before a dissection can be made without damage; the work will be greatly facilitated by the use of a binocular microscope. This may be called the dry method; it is not recommended for Lyc{\ae}nid{\ae}.</p>

<p>For wet preparations the procedure varies with different workers. The abdomen is softened in a solution of 10 per cent. caustic potash, either by boiling in a small open dish (not in a tube) or by allowing the specimen to remain in the cold liquid for many hours. After washing in water, the genitalia can be dissected away from the body under water by means of two needles and the fine-pointed forceps. If the organs still require further cleaning they can be heated in the potash again, care being taken not to destroy the hairs and bristles. The genitalia, after being well washed in several changes of water, should now be examined, and a preliminary study made of the parts before they are dissected. The parts must then be transferred to 70 per cent. alcohol, twice changed, for a few minutes; thence through 90 per cent. alcohol to absolute alcohol, and finally into xylol or toluol for some minutes, after which transfer back through fresh alcohols to 70 per cent., unless it is desired to mount on a slide. Mounting on a slide is not recommended for the larger preparations. Once mounted, a complete examination cannot be made in these cases; moreover, some distortion may result from pressure, or the part may move during mounting, and not be in the desired position.</p>

<p>Prepare some small tubes containing 70 per cent. alcohol and fitted with stoppers made of elder-pith; corks are apt to stain the alcohol and discolour the specimen. These tubes should be placed in a jar, such as a fruit-preserving jar, with a stopper that hermetically seals the contents. This jar has a layer of cotton-wool on the bottom, and is filled with 70 per cent. alcohol. The tubes should contain a small label, written in indelible ink, bearing the number of the specimen from which it was derived. A large label on the outside of the jar will give a list of the contents. Any specimen of genitalia so stored is readily assessible for complete examination.</p>

<p>4. <i>Preparation of Larv{\ae}</i>.&#x2014;The collector should endeavour to preserve the early stages of the species he is collecting, whenever these can be acquired. It may be found convenient to have these in the collection with the imago. To kill the larv{\ae} it is best to use a fixative to ensure rapid killing and prevent contraction. Bl\'es Solution is well recommended, and is prepared as follows :&#x2014;Alcohol 70 per cent. (90 parts); formalin (40 per cent. solution formaldehyde) (7 parts); glacial acetic acid (3 parts).</p>

<p>The following method of preparing dry specimens of larv{\ae} is given by Tillyard (1926) :&#x2014;</p>

<p>``Fix the specimens alive in Bl\'es Solution, laying the tubes on their sides so that the insects die extended. In the case of certain larv{\ae} covered with a waxy film, into which the fixative will not penetrate, immersion for a short time in chloroform is usually sufficient to remove the film. Leave in the fixative till thoroughly hardened (several weeks for medium to large specimens); then dehydrate in absolute alcohol for one to three days. Make a few incisions here and there in the cuticle with the sharp point of a knife or scalpel, and transfer specimens to xylol or chloroform. When the specimen is thoroughly cleared, remove from the liquid and allow to dry on a piece of filter-paper. The tissues being hardened, the insect will not collapse, and can be mounted in any suitable way required; in the case of green larv{\ae} the colour will have been lost. For larv{\ae} which are semi-transparent in life, the natural appearance can be attained by passing the specimen from chloroform into a solution of paraffin-wax in the same liquid at about 40&#xb0; C. for some hours; then rinse sufficiently in chloroform to remove the film of wax on the cuticle, and dry as before. As considerable quantities of absolute alcohol are required in these processes, it is best prepared by heating crystals of copper sulphate until the anhydrous form is obtained, and then shaking this up in a jar %raghu .pdf 81</p>
