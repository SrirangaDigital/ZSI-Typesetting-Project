<p><i>Papilio chaon</i>, Westwood, 1845, p.97, pl.72, fig. i; Rothschild, 1895, p.292; Bingham, 1907, pp.58-9; Lathy, 1904, p.69. <i>Sadengia chaon</i>, Moore,
1907, p.213, pl.457,figs. 1 a-1 <i>d</i> ({\male}). <i>Papilio chaon chaon</i>, Jordan,1909 a, p.53, t.22 <i>b, c</i>; Evens 1927, p.237, pl. 4 fig.A 4.21({\male}).</p>

<p><i>Papilio chaon</i> {\male} ab. <i>paryphanta</i>, Jordan, 1909 a, p. 53, t.32 b.</p>

<p><i>Papilio chaon</i> {|female} f.leucacantta, Frushstorfer, 1908 d, p.73 (Sikkim); Jordan, 1909 a, p.53.</p>

<p>{\male}.<i>Upperside</i> with black ground-colour. Fore wing with a sprinking of yellowish-brown scales that form four longitudinal streaks in the cell and internerular distal streaks. Hind wing with the white discal area formed of elongate board spots in areas 4 to 7; neither tornal nor subarginal markings.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> ground-colour duller brounish-black. Fore wing with the diffuse scaling so dispersed as to form grey cellular and internervular 
streaks, those in area 1 <i>a</i> and 1 <i>b</i> generally white, not diffuse. Hind wing with the the basal area sprinkled with yellow scales that 
form three longitudinal slender lines in the cell; white discal patch as above, but the spots well divided by the black venis; below the discal patch a
small series of white spots in areas 1 to 3, the spot in 1 generally, in 2 very often, tinged with ochraceous-yellow lunules followed by marginal narrow white spots.</p>

<p>{\femmal}. Paler with larger markings. Fore wing above often with an obscure diffuse whitish subcostal shading just beyond apex of cell. Fore wing below somtimes with a series of more or less conspicuous marginal white spots, Abodomen beneath with lateral white marking.</p>

<p>Expanse: {\male} {\female} , 115-130 mm.</p>

<p>Variation.- There is a rare form of the {\male} in which the yellow submarginal spots of the hind wing are greatly enlarged, the posterior and anterior almost as large as the second white discal spot. This is called <b>PARYPHANTA</b> Jord.</p>

<p>A rare form of {\female}, in which the cell of the fore wing bears a large area of white scaling, is called <b>leucantha</b> Fruhst.</p>

<p>The size of the white patches on the hind wing and of the submarginal spots, as the length of the wings, is very variable.</p>

<p><b><i>Habitat.-</i> NEPAL to NORTHERN BURMA; common</b>.</p>

<p>47 <i>b</i>. <b>PaPilio chaon ducenarius</b> Fruhstorfer.</p>

<p><i>Papilio chaon ducenarius, Fruhstorfer</i>, 1908 <i>d</i>,p.73 (Tenasserim); Jordan, 1909 <i>a</i>, p.51.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}: The white area of the hind wing larger than in the nominotypical from, the fourth patch anteriorly produced into a long which projects beyond the third patch.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.-SOUTHERN BURMA; not rare. According to Ollenbach (1921) the insect in Tavoy prefers the low country and was not seen on the hills.</p>

<p><b>Papilio noblei</b> de Nec\'eville.</p>

<p>A peculiar and very distinct species allied to <i>antonio</i> Hew. from the Philippines, but with quite different genitalia.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing black, rarely with a white spot at the inner margin. Hind wing white discal area reaching vein 5, and this area rather narrow costally. Hind wing below lunular dark ochraceous spots.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.-NORTHERN BURMA to the KAREN HILLS and east to Tong-king, The nominotypical form occurs in the Indian area, and a distinct race, as yet unnamed, occurs in central Tong-king. Few specimens of either are to be found in collections. Only the {\female} is known of the Tong-king race; this is the form figured by Jorden in Seitz's Macrolep., ix, 1909, t. 21 b.</p>

<p>48.<b>Papilio noblei</b> de Nice\'eville.</p>

<p><i>Papilio nobali</i>, de Nice\'eville, 1889 <i>a</i>, p.287, pl.13, fig.2({\male}) (Karen Hills); Rothschiled, 1895, p.284; Bingham, 1907, pp.60-1; Jordan, 1909 <i>a</i>, p.52 (part.); Evans, 1923, p.238; id., 1932 <i>a</i>, p.51.</p>

<p><i>Papilio henricus</i>, Oberthur, 1893, p.3, pl. 4, fig.39 ({\male}) (Tong-king).</p>

<p><i>Papilio noblei haynei</i>, Tytler, 1926, p. 249 (Myitkyina, N.Burma).</p>

<p>({\male}). <i>Upperside</i> black. Fore wing with four slender lines in the cell and the veins paler than the ground-colour. Hind wing with a dark ocharceous incomplete ring at the tornal angle, enclosing a deep black ovel spot; above this a discal cremy-white patch that consists of a quadrate spot in area 7, an elongate rectangular spot in 6, and a trapezoidal spot in 5.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with duller and brownish-black ground-colour; lines in the cell greyish-white and prominent; a small white discal spot in area 2 followed by a marginal series of short white lines between the veins. Hind wing with the basal third dull brownish-black irroared with greyish scales; discal white patch as above, but slightly larger; below it an elongate mark in area 1, and a submarginal complete series of broad ochraceous-orange lunules; the lower discal area, the tail, and the ground-colour before and behind the upper submarginal lunules velvety black. Antenn{\ae}, head thorax, and abdomen black; beneath, the palpi and thorax marked with greyish-white, the abdonmen more yellowish.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}, 110 mm.</p>
<p><i>Variation</i>.-Specimens occur in which the fore wing above bears a quadrate white spot in the middle of areas 1<i>a</i> and 1<i>b</i>,with the vein dividing them also white in this area. This is <b>henricus</b> Ob., and is known from Muong-Mou in Tong-king. It is not unlikely that similar specimens will be found in the Indian area. The form represents a transition to the more easterly Tong-king race.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.-The nominotypical form occurs in the district of Myitkyina (pronounced ``Mitchinar'') in NORTHERN BURMA, extending to the Karen Hills and east to the Sawasi River area and western Tong-king. Always very rare.</p>

<p><b>Papilio fuscus</b> Goeze.</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. The body similar to that of <i>helenus</i>, the palpi laterally entirely white. Fore wing of the {\male} without secnt-stripes. Hind    wing with a white discal band, which is broader above than beneath, and some indistinct spots in the distal area. <i>Underside</i> of hind wing with some  blue discal spots and with yellowish-red submarginal spots. {\female} paler, with larger markings.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i>(from Jordan, 1909a):-</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>.-Light green pale yellow, laid singly upon <i>Citrus</i> leaves near their tips on the upper or under surface.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.-At first a dirty green, anteriorly and posteriorly whiteish, with a black V-spot in the middle of the back; at each end of the back a row of small white spines; head glossy black. When full-grown very variable in colour. Usually brown-red mixed with yellow and olive-green, the underside pale greenish or whitish; an oblique band begins posteriorly at the thorax smaller oblique lateral spots also on some other segments, the pronotum and the 11th segment wwith a pair of tubercles.</p> 

<p><i>Pupa</i>.-Glossy green, beneath in the middle strongly convex, dorsally only feebly incurved, with short thoaracic horn, the wing-cases uniformly projecting. The contour viewed from above forms almost a parallelogram, the head truncate and produced into a point on each side.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.-The ANDAMAN ISLANDS to Australia and the Solomen Island, but absent from Sumatra, Java, the small Sunda Islands, and the Philippines. At least eighteen subspecies are known one of which is confined to the Andamans.</p>

<p>The butterflies occur in open forests with undergrowth, and usually common.</p>

<p><i>Papilio fuscus prexaspes</i>, 1907, p.59.</p>

<p>{\male}.Smaller than <i>P</i>.chaon which it resembles, the fore wing more produced, with incurved outer margin. <i>Upperside</i> with brownish  sooty-black ground-colour. Hind wing with the discal white patch extended into area 4, most usually very slighty so, often represented only by a very small  spot of white scaling, a white spot also above the tornal angle.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with the internervular brownish-yellow streaks limited to the apical area. Hind wing with discal patch extended to the inner margin in a series of three series of lunules formed of diffuse blue scales, and the sub-margins series of dark ochraceous lunules smaller and darker than in chaon.</p>

<p>{\female}.Fore wing an ill-defined board pale discal band perceptibly widended and becoming whitish opposite apex of cell. Hind wing with the discal extension into area 4 more pronouncd than in the {\male}, and the small white spot above the tornal angle sometimes followed by a blue ill-defined lunule and an ochraceous spot.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with white discal band  which is much more prominent than above. Hind wing with the  post-discal series of blue lunules generally complete and well marked.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>:{\male}{\female}, 105-115 mm.</p> 

<p><i>Habibit</i>.-ANDAMAN ISLANDS; rare. Not known elsewhere within the Indian area.</p>

<p><b>Papilio hipponous</b> Felder.</p>

<p>Resembles <i>P. polytes</i>Linn. Fore wing with a narrow yellowish submarginal band, only represented in the Indian race by a small spot near the inner margin. {\female} paler than the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.-The males may be taken drinking at puddles and springs.</p>

<p><i>Disribution</i>.-LOWER BURMA to Silm, the Philippines, and extending to Sangir and the Talaud Islands. Always rare. A single subspecies occurs in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Papilio pitmani leptosephus</i>, Fruhstorfer,  1909 <i>b</i>,p.178 (Assam); Jordan, 1909 <i>a</i>, p.60; Evans, 1932 <i>a</i>, p.52(=<i>pitmani</i>).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}.<i>Upperside</i> more brownish-black than in <i>P.polytes</i>. Fore wing more thickly irrorated with yellowis scales; an obscure yellowish-brown spot (not always present) in areas 1 <i>a</i>  and <i>b</i> close to the tornal angle; no marginal spots; cilia black, with a few touches of white on the posterior half of the wing. Hind wing discal band with the posterior spot or two brownish-yellow, the band wider in the middle; the tornal ocellus generally obscure and ill defined.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> with duller ground-colour. Fore wing with more prominent yellowish irroration, formed into lines in the cell, and with internervular  broad streaks on the anterior half of the wing; a transverse submarginal series of diffuse white spots that vary from from a single spot in area 1 a to double spots in areas 1 <i>b</i> to 4.  Hind wing with a post-discal band as above, followed by a submarginal series of yellow lunules. Cilia black, irregularly alternated with white. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen dull brownish-black.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>:{\male}{\female}, 90-100 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.-SOUTHERN BURMA; rare. Also found in Siam. Its occurence in Assam (Fruhstorfer, 1909) is extermely  doubtful.</p>

<p><b>Papilio polytes</b> Linn{\ae}us. (Fig.45 <i>a-c</i>, genitalia; fig.46, {\male}; figs.47,48,{\female}).</p>

<p>A very interesting species of wide distribution whose females mimic species of <i>Polydorus</i>, which occur in the same localities.</p>

<p>{\male}. Palpi white laterally. Ground-colour black. Fore wing with white marginal spots which are broader proximally. Hind wing a white post-discal band which consists of spots of about equal size.</p>

<p>{\female}. There are three principal forms: one resembling the {\male},  one with red discal patches on the hind wing. In the two latter forms the fore   wing is back from the base to veins 2 or 3 and along the outer margin; the posteriorly narrowed central area is lighter and traversed by black vein-and fold-stripes; distal margin distinctly underlate, with thin white frings-spots.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i>.-Harpe (fig. 45 <i>a, b</i>) resembles that of the <i>Memmon</i> Group; the broad distal end hatchet-shaped, much broader than in <i>helenus</i>, the dorsal edge unevenly serrate (<i>Gosse</i>, 1883, p.301, p1. xxix, figs. 7-9).</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>.-``Spherical, hardly perceptibly rough on the surface. Pale orange, opaque, shiny, smudged with pale brown. Diameter 1.2mm.'' (Bell,1911).</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.-``Resembles <i>Polymnestor</i>. Head yellow; crests on segments 4 and 5 yellow; ocellus black. The usual two tubercle son segments 2 and 13. Dorsally a rich glaucous green, slightly yellowish on the side; bands and markings on segments 7 to 10 are white, blotched with red-brown or brown, with venter brownish-white  suffused with red-brown or brown. Length 40mm.; breadth 8mm. at the middle'' (Bell, 1911).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.-``Olive-brown, with brown, green, and yellow spots and stripes, the underside of the abdomen milk-white, or the whole pupa green; the horns on the head short, obtuse, rather widely separeted, the thoraxcic horn short, the dorsum at the base of abdomen rather strongly incurved, the wing- cases moderately protruding''(<i>Jordan</i>, 1909 <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Fig. 45.- <i>P. polytes</i> Linn., genitalia. (After Gosse).</p>

<p><i>a</i>, valve and harpe;  <i>b</i>, harpe; <i>c</i>, lateral view of genitalia, both valves removed and segments denuded of scales.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.-The larva feeds chiefly on species of <i>Citrus</i>, but also on <i>Murraya, Triphasia, and Xanthoxylon</i>; it is not very subject to the attacks of ichneumons</p>.

<p>The imago  occurs everywhere in open woods and in gardens at low elevations, in the Himalayas up to 6,000 feet. It seldom rises far from the ground, preferring the shelter of bushes, thick places in the jungle, and of hedges. It is fond of visting  flowers, but does not come to wet places on the roads. The flight of the {\male} is very swift, restless, and oscillating. The {\female} in its slow flight resembles its <i>Poludorus</i> models. The different {\female} forms fly at the same time, but are not equally common. They visit flowers, but are best caught when laying their eggs. The species is very easy to breed, but occasionally remains for a long time in the pupal stage.</p>

<p><i>Bionomics</i>.- This species was made the subject of an important series of breeding experiments carried out in Ceylon by J.C.F Fryer. The results  were published in the Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.Lond. B,cciv, 1913, pp.227-54. It was shown that the relationship existing between the three {\female} forms could be explained on ordinary Mendelian lines. In Ceylon this species has reached a position of Mendelian stability.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.-The Loo Choo Islands, West China, and INDIA to the Moluccas, Timor, and neighbouring islands, expect Tenimber. At least nineteen subspecies may be distinguished, of which only two occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male}.<i>Upperside</i> black. Fore wing with not very  prominent irrorated lines of pale yellowish scales in the cell and apical area; outer margin with a series  of white spots which are narrower at the edge of the wing. Hind wing with a transverse discal series of elongate white spots  from inner margin to area 7, these spots divided by the black veins and succeeded by diffuse ill-defined sparse blue scaling on the post-discal area; at the tornal angle an abscure spot, of a deeper black than  ground-colour, surmounted by a lunule of blue scales.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to above, with duller and more opaque black ground-colour. Fore wing with cellular and internervular irrorated streaks more prominent. Hind wing with the discal series of white spots and blue scaling succeeded by a submarginal more or less incomplete series of dingy white lunules , and a row of small, inear, white marginal spots; the tornal spot divided from the blue scaling by an ochraceous line. Antenn{\ae}, head thorax, and abdomen black; head and thorax anteriorly above, and head thorax, and abdomen below spotted with white, the latter with lateral white lines.                <i>Expanse</i>:{\male} {\female}, 90-100mm.</p>

<p>{\female} form <b>cyrus</b> Fabr.-Similar to the {\male}; the submarginal series of lunules on the underside ochraceous; in spring specimens these spots are red and larger, often also red on the upperside.</p>

<p>{\female} form <b>romulus</b>Cram. (fig.47).- Mimics <i>Polydorus hector</i>, Fore wing crossed obliquely from the middle of the cell to the tornal angle by a board white band somewhat as in <i>P.hector</i>, the edges of the band ill defined; this followed by an ill-defined white patch beyond apex of cell .

<p>1.Ab.<b>sakontala</b> Hew.---<i>Upperside</i> dull, somewhat brownish-black. Fore wing very sparingly irrorated with yellowish scales that form ill-defined cellular and internervular streaks. Hind wing with a discal series of very diffuse greenish-white spots in areas 1 to 7 and an ill defined tornal reddish lunule; the spots in areas 5 and 6 are the most diffuse, and beyond the whole series there is a post-discal slight irroration of whitish scales.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing opaque dark brown, the internervular streaks brorader, more prominent than on the upperside. Hind wing black, with a discal series of elongate dingy white spots, larger and more clearly defined than above, followed by a large tornal, more or less vermiliom-red spot with a black centre, and a submarginal series of similarly coloured lunules; the discal spot in area 2 bordered  distally by an outwardly-curved lunule Cilia black alternated with white.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with dullar ground-colour on the fore wing, more sooty-brown than black. Fore wing as on the upperside, but the lines or bands of the post-discal series more elongate in the anterior interspaces. Hind wing with slightly darker ground-colour, the blue discal band replaced by short, very broad streaks of inwardly ochraceous, outwardly blue scales in areas 1 to 4, and indications of similar streaks in the areas above, the ochraceous and blue scaling of the streaks separated by a black spot; the post-discal spots and marginal narrow lunules as on the upperside but larger; an intervening series of velvety black spots between the discal and post-discal markings. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen sooty-black, a few white specks on the thorax below. </p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: 113 mm.</p>

<p>Since a specimen taken in Southern India received this name in 1879 no others have been found.</p>

<p>3.Ab.<b>astreans</b> Jord.---<i>Upperside</i> of fore wing much larger marginal white spots which extend into area 8. Hind wing with the discal white spots replaced by a series of velvety black spots daker than than the ground-colour, borderd on the inner side narrowly, on the outer side much more broadly, by ill-defined diffuse blue scaling; the black tornal spot in area 1 centerd by an irrgular deep ochraceous-red spot; above this a quadrate white spot, and, in line with it in area 2 is a similar but narrower white spot; there is a minute white discal spot also in area 5.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> resembles the upperside, ground-colour duller. Fore wing with larger marginal spots. Hind wing with  discal series of extermely elongate streaks beyond the cell; these streaks are rich ochraceous-red mixed with white, but become pure white in the anterior areas; the streaks in areas 1 to 5 interrupted along their inner halves by a row of spots of a shade darker than the ground-colour and outwardly  borderd by diffuse blue scaling.</p>

<p>A single example was taken in the Nilgiris. A second specimen upon which the name is based, was taken at Coimbatore in South India. In this the two posterior discal spots of the hind wing above are small and white, the others are absent or replaced by bluish nebulous spots, which are joined to a second row of bluish spots. Underside of hind wing with five white discal spots which form the proximal boundary of long red, bluish, and yellowish-grey stripes, whose discal ends correspond to the submarginal spots of normal specimens.</p>

<p>Two unimporant {\female} forms have been named by Fruhstorfer.{\female} f. <b>cyroides</b> Fruhs. is said to represent dry-season <i>cyrus</i> specimens from Sikkim. Fore wing with large ochre-yellow marginal spots; hind wing on both sides with a compelte row of larger pale red submarginal lunules.</p>

<p>The name <b>rubida</b> Fruhst. indicates specimens of <i>romulus</i> {\female} with the red markings of the hind wing much enlarged, especially the patch in area 1 and the cell-spot. The type is illustrated by fig. 1 <i>b</i> on plate 464 in Lep. Ind. vol. v.</p>

<p>Aberrations of the {\female} are even rarer. A remarkable specimen in which two forms are mixed is described and figured by O.C.Ollenbach in the Journ. Bombay Nat.Hist.Soc. xxxiv, p. 832, 1930. The right side is of the <i>romulus</i>  form and the left side of the <i>cyrus</i> form, except for two splashes of red on the white discal band above. The left wings are smaller than  those of the right. The specimen was taken at Dehra Dun in October, 1924, by Miss Floris Tarachand.</p>

<p><i>Bionomics</i>:-The species has been closely studied on Barkunda Island in Lake Chilka, in the north-east corner of Madras (<i>Annandale {amp; Dover, 1921</i>). It is common there, and all three forms of {\female} were taken. The <i>stichius</i> form was much the most abundant, and the <i>cyrus</i> form extremely rare; only one <i>cyrus</i> was taken in two seasons. The <i>stichius</i> form is probably at least three times as abundant as the <i>romulus</i> form. The species bred in considerable numbers in the thickets of <i>Glycosma</i> that cover a large part of the island, and in the opinion of the observers its  abundance was probably due not so much to any special freedom attack bestowed upon it by its polymorphic and mimetic females as to the abundance of its  food-palnts, the scarcity of competitors, and its skill in threading its way through the dense branches and foliage of the shrubs.</p>

<p>The same authors (1921) give an account of the distribution of the {\female} forms. It appears from this the commonest  form is <i>stichius</i> (called <i>polytes</i> by the authors), which occurs all over Peninsular India, extending to Burma, where in the north, it is the only form found. Next comes the <i>romulus</i> form, which ocupies all the area. covered by its model <i>P.hector</i>, and extends to Kumaon, where it occurs in the Terai; in the districts of Dehra Dun and Lucknow it is much less common.</p>

<p>The form <i>cyrus</i> is the least common, and appears to be absent from Kumaon, the Konkan, and around Lucknow and Madras City. It occurs in Tavoy.</p>

<p>No mention is made of Ceylon, Sikkim, or Assam in the table given by Annandale and Dover. If the observations for Peninsular India are correct a more variable relationship exists there between the {\female} forms than is the case in Ceylon, where, as stated previously, a condition of Mendelian stability has been reached.</p>

<p>Williams (1927, p.19) records this species as having taken part in a migratory filght in Ceylon.</p>

<p><i>Papilio demolion limedon</i>, Rothschild, 1895, p. 283; Bingham, 1907, pp.44, 45: Evans, 1923, p.238; id., 1927, p. 32; id., 1932 <i>a</i>, p.52.</p>

<p><i>Araminta liomedon</i>, Moore, 1902, p.221, pl.466, figs. 1 <i>a</i> 1 <i>c</i> (larva, pupa, {\male} {\female}).</p>

<p>This species was conidered by Jordan (1909a) to be distinct from <i>demolion</i> on account of a difference in the genitalia. Both are geographically quite separaed, and although one must have been derived from the the other. it would appear that <i>liomedon</i> has become specifically distinct. similar cases of distinct but closely allied species occur in the Malay islands.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> brownish-black. Both wings crossed by a broad, prominent, oblique, greenish-yellow band from the apex of fore wing to the middle of the inner margin of hind wing; on the fore wing the band is composed of separate spots; on the hind wing the band passes through the apex of the cell. Hind wing with a submarginal series of green-yellow lunules.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> fuliginous-black with transverse band as above, and other markings very smiilar to those in <i>demolion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: 90-100mm.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i>.---``Harpe of {\male} broad and flat, dentate at the margin, without pointed processes. {\female} armature consisting principally of two dentate and rounded-off triangular chitinous lobes, each of which is placed laterally behind the vaginal opening'' (<i>Jordan,</i> 1909a),</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i>.---The following account is from Davidson and Aitken (1890):--A {\female} was observed laying its eggs on a tender shoot of a small jungle tree or shrub (<i>Acronychia laurifolia</i> B1.). There were ``ten eggs laid one on top of the other.'' Of the caterpillars which emerged five days after the eggs were laid, ``five passed succssfully through all dangers and became beautiful specimens, one female and four males. (This is one of the  butterflies of which we rarely find females). All through their lives these larv{\ae} continued gregarious, dispersing occasionally to feed, but always returning to rest side by side on the upper surface of a leaf. The following dates may be interesting. Eggs laid 2nd August, hatched 7th August; skins cast (and eaten) 12th August; again 17th August; again 20th to 22nd August. The most advanced cast its skin again on the 28th  August, became a pupa on the 2nd September, and emerged on the 15th September. The others followed within two days. At first the larv{\ae} were of an oily yellow colour and bore many pairs of spiny points, but these disappeared with age, and after the last moult there were only the short fleshy processes on the 2nd and last segment which characterize the group, and one additional curved pair on the 9th segment.</p>

<p>``The colour after the last moult was a clear slaty-blue, changing eventually to a greenish tint, with light brown markings very much the same as those which characterize the rest of the group. The pupa was more abruptly bent back from the middle of the thorax than that of <i>P.erithonius (i. e. P.demoleus)</i> and adorned on the thorax  with a sword-shaped horn, fully three-eighths of an inch long, and always bent either to the right or the left. The colour was brown or green and yellow according to situation.''</p>

<p>Bell (in MSS.) notes:--``Many eggs are parasitized by a very small black ichneumon; in a stick of eggs none escape as a rule. The larv{\ae} are often parasitied, but by a different species of ichneumon; if one larva of a brood suffers, then the whole lot perish as a rule. The mortality, calculated in deposited. The imago is usually local, in some years scarce. In 1901 in Karwar it was extremely numerous. Some are always to be caught in the monsoon months at the tops of hills in the jungle, where they fly along through the tree-tops in the thickest places. The females flies lower down in even come near the ground. Hannyngton says it is double-brooded, and comes to flowers. of <i>Muss{\ae}nda frondosa</i>Linn., family Rubiace{\ae}.</p>	

<p>``Kanara specimens show a slight sprinkling of yellow scales on the upperside of fore wing in both sexes, and the hind wing underside at the base is sprinkled plentifully with grey scales inside the broad white band.''</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---SOUTHERN INDIA.</p>

<p>According to Yates (1931) this is the rarest <i>Papilio</i> found in Coorg, where, it freequents evergreen forest, and is attracted by the flowers of <i>Muss{\ae}nda frondosa, Lantana,</i> and <i>Clerodendron</i> among others. Occasionally comes to water.</p>

<p><b>Papilio demolion</b> Cramer.</p>

<p>Resembles <i>limedon</i>, the posterior spots of the band of the fore wing always contiguous, and on hind wing the band does not enter the cell.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i>.--``Harpe of {\male} almost linear, and bears towards the base and at the tip a long spine-like process. The {\female} armature consists proncipally of two  dentate, pointed, triangular chitinous lobes, each of which is placed laterally behind the vaginal opening'' (<i>Jordan</i>, 1909a).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.--Frequents wooded country and visits flowers, before which it hovers with a fluttering motion of the wing, as it sucks the honey. Ollenbach (1921 a), writing of this species in Tavoy, says it is ``common in dense forest in the hills and occassionally along streams at the foot of the hills. It has a very rapid flight, and is difficult to catch. It has a regular beat, round and round which it goes during the warmest hours of the day.''   </p>
<p><i>Disribution</i>.--BURMA to Lombok and Palawan. One of the three known subspecies is found in the Indian area.</p>

The green dorsal part of segments 2 to 5 is bordered narrowly with a curved black line, and does not reach the base of the legs, the part below, as well as abdomen and legs, being a dirty transparent white. On segments 8 to 9 is a diagonal band reaching from the centre of 9 near dorsum to the anterior margin of segment 8; this band is irregular in contour and is yellow-brown spotted with lighter colour. There is a similarly coloired patch at the posterior lower margin of segment 10. Prolegs large and fleshy. The bands are sometimes obsolescent. Osmeterium flesh-coloured. Length 33 mm.;  Width 7 mm. (from <i>Bell</i>, 1911).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.-- Head with two short frontal projections which are separated widely and squarely by a sharp ridge forming the front margin of head.

<p>{\male} {\female}. This race is very close to <i>sphyrus</i>  H\dd{u}., the dark form Southern Europe. It has always very broad black bands, and differs chiefly from <i>sphyrus</i> in having the yellow-dusted discal band of the hind wing beneath much narrower at vein 4.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing dull black irrorated on its basal third withyellow scales, which also form a transverse diffuse post-discal band and a diffus preapical spot; broad band across the middle of the cell, another narrower and similar band at its apex, a narrow streak at base of area 9, a quadrate spot near base of area 8, a transverse discal series of broad stripes that decrease in length towards the costa in areas 1 a to 7, and a submarginal series of crescentic spots creamy-yellow area comprising the cell and stripes beyond the cell are variable in length and occupy fully three-fourths of the inner margin and of area 1; they decrease suddenly and considerably in areas 2 to 5 and lengthen again in the anterior areas. Distal area of wing black with a superposed post-discal transverse series of diffuse blue spots and a submarginal series of cream-coloured Lunules. An ochraceous-red tornal spot below the blue post-discal spot in area 1 ; base and inner margin shaded with black irrorated with yellow scales; fringes prominently yellow between the veins. The depth of the tint of the cream-coloured portions of both wings is very variable; so also is the width of the black areas, especially on the hind wing, and the size of the blue post-discal spots on this wing.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i>pale cream-colour. Fore wing with two transverse short bands across the cell, and one beyond its apex where it borders the discocellulars; a prominent broad transverse discal band and a marginal broad line; all these markings black; the bands across the cell and beyond its apex more or less diffuse, the discal band with its middle very broadly cream-coloured from areas 2 to 7, and thickly sprinkled with black scales. Hind wing with the veins and a marginal broad line black; the black on the upperside shows through as an irregular, transverse, sinuous bluish discal band thickly sprinkled with black scales, and is bordered on its inner and outer edges by broken transverse black lines, the inner line margined on the outer side by a diffuse blue scaling, and on the inner side in areas 3 and 4 by an ochraceous-red spot; tornal spot and frings of both wings as above. Antenn{\ae} black; head, thorax, and abdomen cream-colour, on the upperside with a black mesial streak, which is narrow in the {\ae} and very broad in the {\female}; abdomen beneath with narrow lateral ill-defined black lines.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male} {\female}, 75-90 mm.</p>

<p>Fig. 52.---<i>a, P. machaon asiatica</i> Me\'e.; <i>b, P. machaon ann{\ae}</i> Gistel. tornal portion of hind wing.</p>

<p>{\male}. Differs from <i>ladakensis</i> in the longer tails, in the usually narrower and more acute fore wing, in the increased black markings, and in the position and extent of the submarginal bands, which are uniformly broad, and reduced, especially in the cell. The veins on the hind wing in <i>ladakensis</i> bear few scales or none, but in <i>asiatica</i> they are entirely scaled, The inner area of hind wing and the abdomen not so strongly hairy as in <i>ladakensis</i>, the hairs darker. <i>Upperside</i> with both submarginal dark bands usuallly present, whilst in <i>ladakensis</i> the distal band is absent; the stripe dividing the two bands in <i>iasiatica</i> is yellowish, but in <i>ladakensis</i> the greater part of this area is yellow, and the stripe appears yellowish-green.</p>

<p>At least two broods occur, expect at the higher elevations. The summer specimens are larger than those which emerge from hibernated pup{\ae} in the spring.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---North of the Indus; CHITRAL and KASHMIR to Tibet as far as Everest (Rongshar Vally). Occurs in the valleys from February to October, but in the mountains not before March or April, from 2,000 to 14,000 feet.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> black with cream-coloured markings. Fore wing with four or five slender, somewhat broken streaks in the cell that extend from the base for two-thirds of its length; following these is a short transverse bar and another similar bar along the discocellulars; a streak from the base not extended beyond the disc in areas 1 <i>a</i>, and 1, the streak in the latter angulated downloads below the orgion of vein 2, its apical portion double;  a discal series of elongate subtriangular spots, that decrease in size towards the costa, in areas 2 to 7, the spots in 6 and 7 with an oval black medical spot generally dividing them in two; a spot near base of area 8 followed by a diffuse small patch of similarly coloured scales; a complete submarginal series of lunules. In the {\female} between the discal and submarginal series there is a complete post-discal series of transverse, somewhat diffuse pale spots. Hind wing with a broad basal cell-streak nearly filling the cell; a basal streak in area 1 extended for three-fourths the length of this area; shorter streaks beyond the cell; that in area 7 interrupted by a large black spot (paler in the {\female}); a post-discal series of diffuse spots, cream-coloured (except the tornal spot, which is blue) in the {\male}, blue in the {\female}, followed by a submarginal series of cream-coloured lunules, the lunule at the tornal angal centred with black in the {\male}, in the {\female} also centred with black, but with its upper half ochraceous; the lunule in area 8 with its upper horn elongate, produced down the tail.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing similar to above, the cream-coloured markings broader, the post-discal spots present also in the {\male}; in the both sexes that and the submarginal series form continuous bands.

<p>Tribe III. GRAPHIINI</p>

<p>The members of this division are known as Kite Swallow tails, as the long wings and long tails of the majority of species give them a kite-like appearance. They are found in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Antenn{\ae} short strong club; upperside in fresh specimens scaled like the tibi{\ae} tarsi, the fine sensory hairs almost uniformly distributed over the proximal part of the underside of each segment. Tarsi with the dorsal spines separated from the vental ones by a spineless, somewhat impressed intespace. Wings in most species thinly scaled semitransparent, especially in the costal part of fore wing. The green and bluish bands and spots on the upper surface mostly without scales, sometimes also on the under-surface. Fore wing in most species of <i>Graphium</i> with vein 11 running into 12; in some species vein 10 is also united with 12. Hind wing with inner margin bent over upwards and the edge fringed with long hairs; {\male} with usually a patch of yellowish scent-wool inside the fold. Hind wing mostly narrow, its costal margin incurved between veins 7 and 6 (from <i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.---``The young larva with forked hairs; full-grown in the Indo-Australian forms, so far as is known, with a pair of short spines on each of the three thoracic segments and the last segment, the thorax swollen'' <i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.--``Smooth, in the middle rounded in barrel-shape, the wing-cases not projecting, the thoracic horn four-sided, the lateral carin{\ae} forming the prolongation of the upper edge of the wing-cases; on the dorsum two carin{\ae}, converging anteriorly and posteriorly; anal segment longer than broad'' <i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---``They are all good fliers and occur in wooded districts; the mimetic forms imitate the slow flight of their models. The males often rest together in crowds at wayside puddles and on the moist sand of river-banks and can mostly be attracted by urine and the like. The females are taken singly in the woods''<i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p>The Oriental species can be divided into the two genera <i>Graphium</i> Scop. and <i>Lamproptera</i> Grey. The Oriental species of <i>Graphium</i> can be divided into six groups, of which four occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Papilio artisteus</i> var. <i>nigricans</i>, Eimer, 1889, p. 178, fig. R.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. the black bands are more extended than in <i>anticrates</i>. Fore wing with the fourth band narrowed posteriorly and ending on the median vein; the black marginal band very broad, covers more than the outer third of the wing, coalesces with the black band on the discocellulars, and encloses the short macular bar of ground-colour beyond the cell; the  submarginal spots linear. Hind wing as in <i>swinhoei</i>, but with grey anal patch as in typical <i>nomius</i>.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to <i>numius</i>, with wider markings as above. The precostal spur as in <i>numius</i>, and not as in <i>swinhoei</i>.</p>

<p><i>Variation</i>.-- Connected with <i>anticrates</i> by intermediate gradations. Specimens with narrow white discal area on fore wing are called <b>aristeoides</b> Eimer. Specimens in which the cell of fore wing bears only three white bands and the white submarginal band of fore wing and the white discal band of hind wing are posteriorly abbreviated are f. <b>nigicans</b> Eimer.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.--BURMA; rare. Extends also to Siam and the Lesser Sunda Islands, Sumatra, Borneo, Palawan, and the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p><b>Graphium antiphates</b> (Cramer).</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. White, the fore wing above and beneath greenish towards the costa, as also tha basal half of hind wing beneath; fore wing with seven black bands. Hind wing above with black marginal spots and a row of black submarginal spots; the posterior part of the marginal area dusted with grey-black, or the whole margin broadly  grey-black.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with black markings as follows:- Before the inner margin a stripe which is anally united with a subbasal stripe; a double discal band longitudinally divided by the ground-colour, the distal half of which is broken up into spots; a row of submarginal spots, the former ones shaped like the figure 3, at their proximal side yellow patches, which  are for the most part indistinctly defined.Body above black with light lateral stripe, or the abdomen entirely white; underside white with black lateral stripe. Abdominal fold of ({\male}) without scent-wool.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i>.--Described under <i>naira</i> Moore.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.--The males congregate in crowds at puddles and the edges of brooks, where they drink in company with Pierids. The females are taken singly in the woods. On the wing <i>antiphates</i> gives the impression of a Piriod, as the long tails are scarcely noticeble during its swift flight.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form</i>.--{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> with fore wing cell crossed by five short black bands, of which the basal extends to inner margin, the subbasal into area 1, the third and fourth to the edge of cell; the fifth band extends broadly on both sides of the discocellulars and terminates at the lower angle of cell; beyond these are broad post-discal and maginal black bands from costa to tornal angle; the two bands coalese below vein 4 and terminate in a point at the tornus; the white portion of the cell anteriorly between the latter and the margnal band. Hind wing with basal three-fourths uniform white, the black markings showing through from below; the discal fourth dark grey traversed by a curved irregular submarginal series of black lunules that ends in a black tornal spot, and a marginal black band that follows tthe indentations of the wing; the emargination below the black tornal spot edged wuth ochraceous; tail blackish-grey, edged and tipped with white.</p>

<p>Fig. 58.--- <i>G. antiphates naira</i> (Moore).</p> 

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing similar to above, but the green shading over the white portions in the basal half of cell more decided; discal and marginal black bands separate, not joined posteriorly, the formaer edged posteriorly on both sides by dark grey due to the black on the uppeside showing through. Hind wing with basal half green, distal half white; a large black tornal spot; a black line along inner margin that curves above tornal spot outwards to veins 2; a straight subbasal black band from costa across cell and ending on vein 2, where it joins the inner black line; a broader black band from costa across apex of cell extended into base of area 3; an irrgular discal series of black markings curved inwards posteriorly towards the tornal spot; a submarinal series of very small slender black lunules in pairs, the ground-colour on the inner side of these darkened to rich ochreous-yellow; a series of short marginal black bars; tail dusky black edged with white.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season-form</i>.--{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with the black bands generally narrower and shorter; the basal band becomes faint posteriorly and barely touches the inner margin; subbasal band very short; post-discal and marginal bands coalesce at vein 4 and do not reach the ending in a point between veins 1 and 2. Hind wing white, with the chrome colouring showing through from below; the marginal black edging narrow, and the submarginal black lunules only just traceable.</p> 

<p><i>Variation</i>.-- The nominatypical form is that of the wet season. The typical dry form is rare, and the British Museum possesses only 2 {\male} {\male} and 1 {\female}.  ``From December until mid-March the butterfly passes through changes from an extreme dry-season form, in which the characteristic broad grey band is completely absent, through intermediate forms, in which the grey tornal area spreads and widens from the neighbourhood of the tail, until the full wet-season form arrives'' (Yates, 1930 <i>a</i>, p. 589).</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.--Surface covered with hardly perceptible semi-appressed white hairs. Colour a darkish transparent-looking olive-green, speckled thinly with white on the dorsum of segments 5 to 14, forming a while dorsal line and a darkish dorso-lateral line; a dark diagonal stripe on segments 5 to 11; a broad, spiracular, white-yellow band below which there is a deep green subspiracular one follwed by a whitish band bordered below by a green one; the flattened deep green dorsum of segments 3 and 4 is surrounded completrly anteriorly, laterally, and posteriorly by a yellow-white band, and the lateral parts of these segments are suffused with reddish-black. Length 40 mm.; width 9 mm. on segment 4 (from <i>Bell</i>, 1912).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.--Bright green, with a yellow dorso-lateral line on segments 4 to 8, where it merges into the lateral line of abdomen; other markings brown, the ventral middle line of yellow. The body-string is unusually long. Length 30 mm.; width mm.; thoracic point 1 mm. long (from Bell, 1912).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.--The egg is laid singly on the upperside of a fresH leaf or shoot. The larva feeds on <i>Unona lawii</i> Hook., a climbing shrub belonging to the Anonace{\ae}. In the last stage the larva never lies out in the sun; it is sluggish and walks with a halting motion. The butterfly is most plentiful in the monsoon months, and may be seen circling in graceful flight around the tops of trees in the evergreen jungle. During the hot hours it decends from the trees in search of water, its fondness for this being thus described by Yates:-``Its thrist appears to be considerable; once it has settled it is not easily driven away; thus it may settle among crowd of Pieriods which, on the appoarch of a human being with a net, rise and scatter, leaving <i>P. antiphates naira, </i>, which remains unmoved, greedily sucking moisure, an easy prey'' (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxiv, 1931).</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---PENINSULAR INDIA; fairly common in the wet season, the {\female} rare.</p>

The  13th segment is of a pale transparent blue-green. A pale yellow subdorsal line and an almost white spiracular line are the only markings. Head of a greenish-yellow. Legs claspers, and abdomen of the same colour as the 13th segment. The 13th segment ends in two sharp points which join at the end, so the division between them is visible only on a close examination'' (<i>Robson</i>, 1895).</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. Discal bands broader than in the preceding race, and of uniform green. Hind wing with the median vein mostly white where it crosses the discal band; tail shorter.</p>

<p><i>Variaton</i>.-- In the northern districts a spring and summer form occurs. In the broad-banded spring form veins 1 to 3 are more or less white where they cross the discal band. In the summer form, called <b>melas</b> Fruhst., the band is narrower and the veins are black.</p>

<p>A. dark aberration of the {\male} from Sikkim is figured and described by de Nic\'eville (1896). The discal band of fore wing above is reduced to the anterior and posterior spots; the posterior spot is represented by an irregular small irroarted patch of blue scales heavily oversprinkled with black scales.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.--KASHMIR to BURMA; common. Also on Hainan, and extending to Tong-king, the Philippines, and Lombok.</p>

<p><i>Lamprosura</i>, Boisduval, 1836, p. 380.</p>

<p>Type, <i>L.meges Zink</i>.</p>

<p>This genus is better known as <i>Leptocircus</i>, but like many other well-known names <i>Leptocircus</i> must be superseded according to the rules of priority. <i>Lamproptera</i> is a very distinct genus with sharply-defined facies; especially characteristic are the long, narrow tails and comparatively long antenn{\ae}. It differs from most other Graphiini in having veins 11 and 12 of the fore wing free; one species has a scent-fold on the hind wing, as in most others of the tribe, and has also, as in the <i>Payeni</i> Group, a tooth on each of the tarsal claws. Besides this, the strongly-built body, the markings of body, and wings, and the scaled greenish legs recall the species of <i>Graphium</i>. The fore wing has a strong median spur which connects with the thickened basal part of the fold and not with vein 1 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>``Head broad, thorax thick, abdomen scarcely longer than the thorax.  The antenn{\ae} extend beyond the apex of the cell of fore wing; above scaled, the sensory hairs almost uniformly distributed over the scaleless underside; club short and broad. Legs scaled. Fore wing with veins 11 and 12 from the cell, 8 and 9 lonng-stalked, 7 from this stalk nearer to the cell than to branch 8, anterior angle of cell pointed; in the hind wing cell very small.</p>


<p>``Fore wing triangular, the hind margin much shorter than the distal margin; before the middle a right oblique band, whichis continued on the hind wing and is in part scaleless; between cell and distal margin a large, transparent,  scaleless triangular area, which is divided by thin black vein-stripes into six to eight spots. Hind wing narrow and long, folded, produced into a very long tail, which is distally edged with white. {\male} and {\female} similar; {\female} with a large ventral copulation-groove before the tip of the abdomen'' (<i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>,``The butterflies are common in most parts of their range. They occur near the water in open places, over which they dart backwards and forwards near the ground, their  rapid flight resembling that of dragonflies; they are immoderate water drinkers, and often squirt the water out again rhythmically at the anus. They are also commonly met with at flowers, before which they hang with the wings vibrating rapidly and the tails quivering and raised high, without resting on the flower'' (<i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.---South-East China to Java, Celebes, and the Philippines.</p>

<p>The two species comprising this genus both occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> black, with green markings; fore wing before the middle with a black, gently curved line and two post-discal, broad, blackish, indistinctly defined shadowy bands; <i>outer margin black with white fringes</i>. Hind wing with a black discal line, at the distal side of which there is a yellow area, the space from here to inner margin edged with white, before the outer margin green-yellow submarginal lunules, tail yellow at tip.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> brownish-yellow with black bands; fore wing with green discal line.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with green basal aera, remainder grey with black bands. Hind wing almost as above, sometimes entirely without yellow.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i>.---As yet imperfectly known. A note on the larva was published by O. Lindgren in Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxvii, 1921, p. 177:- ``The caterpillar was green, with a large, thick head, Papilio-shaped. The pupa was oval, greenish, with a strange horn.'' The larva pupated at the end of september, and the butterfly emerged the following April. The larva was fairly full-grown, and was found on the road near Sukia in Sikkim, at 6,050 feet elevation. The food-plant is said to be a species of <i>Daphne</i>.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.---``The butterfly is very local, and only occurs at medium and higher evelation in the mountains (6,000-10,000) feet in wooded districts. It uasually remains in the tops of trees, from which it only comes down from about 8 to 11, O' clock in the morning when the sun shining, and can then be attracted by baiting. Its flight is exceedingly fast. The best localities are open places on the tops of mountains surrounded by timber forests'' (<i>Jordan</i>, 1909 a).</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> black, densely irrorated with green scales. Fore wing with an outwardly oblique, slightly concave subbasal band and a narrow marginal edging jet-black, due to the ground-colour there being devoid of the green scaling; beyond the subbasal band the irroration of scales is a much brighter green, especially along the outer edge of the subasal band itself, but it thins out to leave shadowy, broad, convergent discal and post-discal bands and a narrower submarginal band; in some specimens, owing to the transparency of the wings the rich ochraceous-brown colour of the underside gives the black on these bands a reddish tint. Hind wing with the basal area margined outwardly by a narrow, irregularly sinuous band devoid of green scaling, followed by an anterior discal bright  chrome-yellow patch that spreads from base of area 3 across the apex of cell and bases of areas 4 and 5 to the costa; this patch is bluntly angulated outwards in area 5, stained with orange anteriorly, and bordered outwardly by black, which is widest above; below the patch a white line extends to the inner margin; the post-discal area is deep dark green, margined inwardly by diffuse dark grey, and followed outwardly by a submarginal series of lunular markings, the tornal and upper two or three of which are yellow, the rest bright green; tail tipped with yellow.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of both wings basal area densely covered with green scales. Fore wing with marginal two-thirds rich ochraceous-brown, the green of the basal area bordered by black; discal and post-discal bands also black, widened and diffusely coalescent posteriorly; an incomplete, very slender submarginal black line and broader black marginal edging, neither of which reaches to the apex. Hind wing much as on upperside, but the yellow markings broader. Antenn{\ae} dark red; head thorax, and abdomen black, covered somewhat densely with green hairs and scales.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with the irroration of green scales on the distal two-thirds restricted to a submarginal moderately broad band diffuse along its inner edge, and a discal, somewhat ill-defined similar band that is bordered both on the inner and outer sides by diffuse dusky black; this is succeeded by two broad diffuse dark grey bands, the outer of the two edged on its distal side narrowly with black, followed by a submarginal green band and outer velvety black margin. Hind wing with a large dark grey discal patch, below which comparatively narrow markings of yellow extend to the inner margin; a post-discal sinuous lunular narrow black band and a submarginal series of green lunules as in the {\male}, but the apical lunule dark grey, not yellow; the tail-like extensions of the margin at apices of veins 3 to 6 are black shaded with green, those at the apices of veins 4 and 6 tipped, the former with yellow, the latter with greenish-white.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> for the most part grey, with markings much as in the {\male}; fore wing a well-marked moderately broad submarginal band which is of a dull ochraceous colour; hind wing grey discal area extending to the apical lunule of the submarginal series.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> dull black crossed by eight ochraceous-white lines; the basal, subbasal, and first discal lines are continued in a series of more or less diffuse curves to the inner margin; the second discal line terminates on vein 3; beyond apex of cell a somewhat broken post-discal line from costa to vein 3, followed by a second post-discal line from costa to inner margin; a third post-discal line is short, somewhat ill-defined, and terminates on vein 4; a complete submarginal line; all the lines expect those that cross the cell formed of a series of short curved lines separated by the veins. Hind wing with similar ochraceous-white lines more or less in continuation of those on the fore wing, with the addition of a broad line along vein 1 and the median vein; these two lines do not reach much beyond the base of vein 4; a large posterior patch, the proximal half scarlet, the distal half velvety black, followed by broad submarginal bright yellow lunules in across 1 to 4; distal half of posterior patch in areas 1 and 2 with very large, ill-defined, superposed white spots thickly shaded with brownish-grey except along their inner margins; tails edged very narrowly with ochraceous-white.    </p>

Hind wing with base of cell crossed by a short ochraceous-white bar, and the edges of the precostal cell with narrow lines of the same colour. Antenn{\ae} black; head thorax, and abdomen dull black; thorax greenish-grey laterally, sides of abdomen with cross-lines of ochrceous-white.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male} {\female}, 90-110 mm.</p>

<p><i>Historical.---A. Lidderdalei</i> was first discovered by Dr.Lidderdale in 1868 in Bhutan, at about 6,000 feet, near Buxa. Between 1886 and 1890 the late H.J. Elwes sent three parties of native collectors from Darjeeling to procure the insect. The first was plundered by Bhotias, the second was attacked by fever and one of its members died, the third had a man killed by a tiger, and all returned unsuccessful. Specimens were later procured by Mr. A. V. Knyvett, then Inspector of police, who gave them to Mr. Elwes. The late  W  Doherty visited the Naga Hills in 1890 and found this butterfly more abundant in the neighbourhood of Mas, Manipur, at 6,000 to 8,000 feet. His description of its habits was published by Elwes in the Proc. Zool. Soc. 1891, p. 249. While chasing one of the butterflies Doherty nearly lost his life by falling into one of the pits dug by the Nagas to catch tigers.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.---``It generally keeps to the ridges, occasionally descending into the valley, once almost down to 5,000 feet Afterwards I found it on the western side of Japoo at 7,000-8,000 feet, and between the two places we got one or two every day. At Mas, in Manipur, I have taken worn specimens at 7,500-9,000 feet. My Lepchas, who collected at Buxa in Bhutan, say there is no chance of another brood. The butterfly drifts about among the tree-tops, rarely descending to the ground; the crimson of the hind wings is not so conspicuous as one might think, and if one again, its transparent dark grey wings being hardly distinguishable among the shadows, and it is blown about by the wind more like a dead leaf than a living insect. Its flight is much like that of <i>Hestia</i>, but less buoyant and circling, as might be expected from its angular wings; nevertheless its resemblance strikes one. Seen from above it must be much more conspicuous and is no doubt a protected insect; at the same time its weak flight may even add to its chance of escape, as it certainly does with <i>Hestia</i>, for it is impossible to calculate the direction in which it is making. The whole body and wings give out a delicious odour, which remains for some days after death. In some patterns and at some distance <i>Armandia</i> looks like <i>Danais tytia</i> Gray, which is very common in the same places. <i>Armandia</i> hovers about flowers like other <i>Papilios</i>. During rain it alights on a leaf and droops its fore wings over the hind ones, thus covering the bright colours'' (<i>Doherty</i>, 1.c.).</p>

<p>This butterfly is also recorded from the Naga Hills by Tytler (1912, p. 588). He found the males not uncommon, the females rare, at 5,500 to 7,000 feet, during the latter half of August, September, and the first half of October. Many specimens were captured on a white-flowering tree which comes into blossom towards the middle of September. Two females, after capture, laid eggs which were yellow, and very small for the size of the insect.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---BHUTAN, the NAGA and CHIN HILLS; rare.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white with a slight cream-yellow tint. Fore wing at the base densely, and on the costal margin lightly, irrorated with black scales; cell with a transverse black median band and a black apical spot, the latter extending from the costa along the discocellulars almost to the lower angle of cell; beyond the cell an oblique short black bar, widened posteriorly and with three superposed red spots, the middle spot minute, sometimes absent ; this is followed by an irregular submarginal black band, widened at the veins, widest near the costa, and gradually narrowed to a faint line posteriorly. Beyond this band the apex is marked with a small diffuse black patch, and the apices of the veins with black spots that are extended inwards to the submarginal band. Hind wing with base and dorsal margin broadly irrorated with black scales; a black upper discal and a subcostal spot, both generally centred with red; a submarginal series of slender black lunules; followed by a marginal row of transversely linear black spots; the discal and post-discal areas of wing darkened by the markings of the underside showing through. Cilia of both wings white alternated with black.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with similar ground-colour. Fore wing markings as above, but the cell-spots, the spot in area 3, and the short bar beyond apex of cell larger, more intensely black, the red spots on the latter also larger; submarginal and marginal markings paler, more diffuse. Hind wing with basal, median,and submarginal broad transverse bands of irrorated black scales, all the bands, with their margins uneven and zigzag; outer margin of basal band with four transversely placed red spots, and transverse red discal spots edged with black, in area 1, 2, 5, and 7; a fine, more or less interrupted, black marginal line. Antenn{\ae} pale yellowish-white, the shafts obscurely ringed with black; head, thorax, and abdomen black, the head and thorax anteriorly with long greyish-white hairs ; underside of palpi, thorax, legs, and basal portion of abdomen similarly clothed.</p>

<p>{\female} (nominotypical form).---<i>Upperside</i> markings larger and more conspicuous than in the {\male}; an additinal large black spot in the middle  of area 1. Underside similar to that of the {\male}, but with the additional black spot as noted above.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male} {\female}, 45-55 mm.</p>

<p>The above description of the {\male} is taken from Moore's type. The {\female} appears to be still unknown from Baluchistan.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---BALUCHISTAN; very rare. The type and a paratype are in the British Museum, the latter(from Coll. Evans) marked ``Nushki, April, 1905''; both were received from Mr.O. C. Ollenbach. There is a specimen labelled ``Kach'' in the Indian Museum. Evans (1932, p.198) did not meet with the species.

<p>{\male} {\female}. Wing broad, semi-diaphanous: character of markings very similar throughout the forms. Fore wing a rectangular triangle, the hind wing almost ovate. Fore wing with costa very slightly arched, apex broadly rounded; outer margin very convex; inner margin straight; cell generally about half length of wing or a little shorter; upper discocellular short or obsolete, middle concave, more than twice length of lower, lower one shaped obliquely inwards; veins 6 and 7 from apex of cell or very close together at base; 9 absent; 8 out of 7, closer to apex of cell than to apex of wing; 10 from just before or from apex, or out of 7 from just beyond apex of cell, typically free, but in some froms anastomosed with 11; 11 from apical half of subcostal vein. Hind wing with costal and outer margins in a continuous curve, apex therefore not well marked; tornus prominent, obtusely angular; inner margin concave. Antenna short, robust, about a third of the length of the fore wing, the shaft often ringed with white and black; club stout, gradual; palpus short, acute, not projecting above the head, thickly fringed with hair anteiorly; eye large and smooth. Thorax densely hairy. Abdomen strongly hairy in the {\male}, sparsely covered with hairs or almost without hairs in the {\female}. The {\female}, after fertilization, with an extended corneous anal pouch that varies in shape. This pouch originates from a quickly hardening substance discharged by the {\male} during copulation. The differences in the shape of the pouch are of great help in distinguishing a species or characterizing a group of species.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.---``Cylindrical, exceptionally tapering at both ends, diversely developed, but mostly of black colour and variously ornamented; head small, almost globular, in the neck a reversible fleshy fork (osmeterium); body covered with short hairy warts; apparently living gregariously when young; some species show a great liking for sunshine, whilst others are concealed in daytime'' (<i>Stichel</i>, 1907 a).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.---Obtuse, thick, more or less, more or less cylindrical, light or dark brown, dusted with glaucous blue. Enclosed in a slight cocoon, to which it is attached by a few threads; pupation underground.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.---``These insects inhabit medium and high altitudes, certain species ascending as high as 20,000 feet. The flight is generally clumsy and fluttering. The Parnassii are visitors of flowers; they sit on the blossom with the wings expanded and are not difficult to catch while sucking the honey, being occasionally, when the weather is unfavourable, or towards evening, so benumbed that they are easily caught with the fingers or even taken off the flowers with the killing-bottle. The butterflies are very tenacious of life'' (<i>Stichel</i>, 1907 a).</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.---As already noted. Thirteen species occur in the HIMALAYAS, and these comprise a number of subspecies and forms.The species of <i>Parnassius</i> are mostly very variable.</p>

<p>The classification of a number of the Indian forms is still in a state of uncertainly, owing chiefly to the lack material. In the present volume several forms are treated as races upon a consideration of the distribution; such treatment is provisional, and the acquisition of more material is much to be desired in order to obtain a more accurate conception of these forms.</p>

<p>It is also as yet uncertain whether <i>maharaja</i> Avin. and <i>stoliczkanus</i> Feld. represent distinct species; some authorities regard the latter as a form of <i>delphius</i> Eversm.</p>

<p><i>Parnassius rhodius</i>, Honrath, <i>auct</i>. (part.).</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}.``This form is very like <i>P.D. baroghila</i>, but averages smaller and is much darker, especially in the females, which are as dark as the females of <i>P.discobolus</i> from the Shandun Pass. It is very near, if not identical with, an unnamed form in the British Museum from the Hindu Kush, and which is the <i>rhodius</i> of other authors.</p>

<p><i>Parnassius actius sulla</i>, Bryk {amp; Eisner, 1934 <i>c</i>, p. 42.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. Ground-colour well developed, in the {\female} much more strongly darkened. Fore wing with vitreous band broad to the inner margin, the submarginal band reaching the anal fold, and strongly curved as in <i>jacquemontii</i> Boisd. Hind wing with broad vitreous band, and with pronounced and extended inner black area; submarginal band of defined lunules  touches the vitreous band; an anal band below the cell; only the anterior costal spot is red-centred; ocelli of normal size, brick-red, and broadly ringed with black.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---CHITRAL: Baroghli Pass. Described from a single pair.</p>

<p><i>Parnassius actius catalina</i>, Eisner{amp; Peschke, 1934, p. 41 (Gilgit).</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. A well differentiated race, allied to <i>minuta</i> Verity. All markings, which tend also to disappear on the hind wing of {\male}.
{\male} with very small vitreous band, fore wing submarginal band shortened; costal spots small,and spot on inner margin very small; cell-spot of normal size; ocelli small inner black area of hind wing moderate, and proximally with only anal spots. {\female} resembles the {\male}, is larger and has relatively broader marginal and submarginal bands, also somewhat larger ocelli.</p>

Fore wing with four black costal spots. a smaller cell-spot, a reduced spot at end of cell, and a large spot on inner margin; submarginal and marginal bands weakly suffused with black; fringes and veins of both wings black. Hind wing with a marginal band of small spots; below with three indistinct red basal and two anal spots.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: 60 mm.</p>

<p>It occurs with <i>P. epaphus</i> Oberth. on the same ground, and contrasts with this by reason of its larger size and bright red ocelli bearing no trace of white centres.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. <i>Upperside</i> pale creamy-white, both wings only slightly irrorated with diffuse black scales; body, base of the wings, and inner area of hind wing clothed with long white hairs. Fringes of both wings more or less speckled with black. Fore wing with a short bar across middle of cell, another along the discocellulars, and a diffuse post-discal series of lunules, black; in many specimens this series is incomplete and does not extend clearly across the wing; three or four crimson spots encircled with black, arranged as follows: one mid-way in area 1, two , sometimes three, beyond apex of cell in an oblique line from the costa; outer margin broadly hyaline, with minute black specks at the apices of the veins; cilia white. Hind wing with basal and inner area beneath the white hairs densely and broadly irrorated with black scales, the inner edge of this border irregular, rest of the wing with more diffuse black scaling; five or six black-ringed crimson spots as follows; two, sometimes three, obliquely above the tornus, these, or one of them, occasionally white-centred; one in the middle of areas 5 and 7 respectively, these generally centred with white; one pure crimson spot at extreme base of wing; a post-discal series of black lunules as on fore wing, but the lunules not so well defined and generally separate from one another; a distinct hyaline outer marginal border, but the cream-white scaling extending to the margin; marginal black specks on the veins and white cilia as on fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> shining, with more or less of a glazed appearance; markings much as on the upperside, but indicated as much by those of the upperside, which show through as by actual scaling; hind wing with a subbasl transverse series of four dull crimson spots, while the crimson spots beyond are all more or less white-centred. Antenn{\ae} deep brownish-black, rarely with a few white specks on the underside; head thorax, and abdomen, beneath the covering of white hair, black. {\female} usually with more black irroration, and with larger and more brilliant crimson spots. Pouch with a sharp, high, posterior carina.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>:{\male} {\female}, 65-75 mm.</p>

<p><i>Variation</i>.---There are three of the named forms which are worth nothing:-</p>

<p><b>(1) rhodius</b> Honrath.---Distinguished by the sharper and more distinct marginal bands, fore wing costal spots without a red pupil, also the spot on inner margin plain black. Hind wing ocelli small and completely filled in with red.</p>

<p><b>(2) impunctata</b> Austaut.---Ground-colour almost white. Fore wing with the costal and inner marginal spots black and submarginal markings reduced. Hind wing without red basal spots, ocelli smaller and red strongly edged with black.</p>

<p><b>(3) archonis</b> Bryk.---Underside with red scales in the submarginal band, which in some cases extend to the hyaline margin.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.---KASHMIR to KUMAON; rare.</p>

<p><b>Parnassius epaphus</b> Oberth\dd{u}r.</p>

<p>{\male} {\female}. A smaller species than <i>jacquemontii</i> Boisd. Ground-colour pure white, with the vitreous marginal bands much narrower than in <i>jacquemontii</i>. Hind wing with the red ocelli rarely pupilled, and then only in the {\female}; anal spots only slightly dusted with red. Fringes of both wings distinctly chequered. Antenn{\ae} ringed with black and white (rarely quite black), which easily distinguishes the species from <i>jacquemontii</i>{\female} pouch not carinate, but bearing transverse folds at the broader end.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.---CHITRAL to BHUTAN, Turkestan to Amdo and South-East China. In the Indian area four subspecies may be distinguished.</p>
