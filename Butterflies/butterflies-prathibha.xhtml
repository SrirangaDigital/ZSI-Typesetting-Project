Fore wing with post-discal black spot as on upperside; outer margins of both wings with minute black, short, transverse slender lines at the apices of the veins that have a tendency to coalesce and form a marginal line as on the upperside. {\female} with the black markings on upperside of fore wing usually slightly broader. Antenn{\ae} dark brown spotted with white, head brownish, thorax and abdomen white.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}{\female}, 35-50 mm.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1912):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Cylindrical, slightly swollen in the middle, becoming abruptly narrow at the top; thirteen longitudinal ribs of triangular section, of which only six reach the top, where their ends, as minute teeth, surround the flat end. Colour blue.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Grey-green, with an indistinct supraspiracular dark line, below which is a whitish spiracular line; a dark dorsal line. The body is crossed transversely by depressed lines at equal distances from each other; between these lines are rows of black, erect, short bristles, surrounded at their bases by a circular green mark; there is a single row between each two lines; interspersed among these bristles are a few white cylindrical tubercles bearing each an erect, white, long hair generally carrying at its tip a drop of amber-coloured transparent liquid; these long hairs are most numerous on segments 2, 12, and 13. Length 17 mm., breadth 2.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Slight and delicate-looking. Cremaster stout, square, with a dorsal depression near hind margin. Surface glabrous, very minutely transversely striated, shiny. Very transparent green, often suffused with pink; a dorsal and lateral brown line, sparsely covered with obsolescent pink-brown spots; a lateral row of black spots on segments 3 to 12, those on 5 exuding a black or white liquid which dries like gum: there is one spot on each segment; beak yellow, with a median ring of seven black spots. Length 13.6 mm., breadth 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1912).&#x2014;Egg laid on the underside of a leaf near the ground, generally on a young leaf. The larva lives on the underside of a leaf as a rule, but may be found on the upperside. Foot-plants: capers. Has been bred upon <i>Capparis heyneana</i> Wall. and <i>Crat{\ae}va religiosa</i> Forst. f., in Kanara. The larva grows rapidly, and the pupal stage lasts about a week.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a very weak flier, and may at all times be found in the undergrowth, fluttering along weakly, with the wings held horizontally, open for longer intervals than is usual with other Pierines. It is conspicuous when flying, but at rest becomes nearly invisible from the pattern of greenish strig{\ae} and lines which cover the exposed parts of the wings; it rests usually on the underside of a leaf, on a thin upright stem or on a dead stick.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon, Peninsular India</span> to Mussooree, <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span>, and the <span class="smallcaps">Andaman Islands</span>. Also extends to Indo-China, Siam, Hainan, and South China. A common species. It extends also in a number of subspecies to Malaya, the Philippines, Celebes, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.</p>

Hind wing: cell a regular oval, slightly over half length of wing; precostal vein long, directed distad; vein 8 reaching to before the middle of the costa; 7 from the cell, reaching the apex of wing; 5 nearer to 6 than to 4; 2 farther from 3 than 3 is from 4. Antenn{\ae} about half length of fore wing, club abrupt. Palpi short, third segment slender, as long as or longer than the second.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p><i>Genitalia.</i>&#x2014;{\female}. These organs are of quite simple construction. The <i>valve</i> is triangular and of variable size, and exhibits much specific variation. Many species possess a curious structure in the middle basal region of the valve. This consists of a rounded hole or groove in the membranous lining, and close to it on the membrane at one side is a short flap or tubercle which is directed towards the groove and sometimes overlays it. The size of the hole and the shape of the flap vary in different species, and many species are quite without this organ. The <i>uncus</i> is formed of three lobes in most species, but in a few only one lobe is present. This organ differs with every species, and sometimes a subspecific difference can be seen. In the determination of species which present close pattern similarities the uncus is infallible (cf. <i>belladonna</i> group).</p>

<p>{\female.} In common with many other genera of Pierid{\ae} the bursal sac bears a sclerotized plate called the <i>lamina dentata</i>. In <i>Delias</i> this plate is found near the lower or larger end of the sac. It is usually long and narrow, with a median constriction, and the armature of teeth is confined to the distal lobes. The form of the plate and its dentition are different in each species. A distinctive form is found in the <i>belladonna</i> and <i>hyparete</i> groups. In the former it is very large and somewhat square, the distal edge of the lobes very slightly rounded, and the armature sparse. In the latter group the plate is very large, with broad and well-rounded lobes.</p>

<p><i>Scent-scales.</i>&#x2014;These scales are found on the fore wing of all species, and are sometimes very abundant. They exhibit considerable variation which is of specific value. Four types of scent-scale are found in <i>Delias</i>: (1) flask-shaped, with a large disc; (2) flask-shaped, with a small disc; (3) flask-shaped, with a large disc and a rather broad neck; (4) long and narrow, the neck rapidly tapering.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.&#x2014;Differs from the larv{\ae} of other Pierin{\ae} in the possession of tufts of long hair which may form either a dorsal and two lateral rows or only a dorsal row.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Stout; head-process short or long, bifid or simple. Often three rows of spines corresponding to the larval hairs.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>&#x2014;The larv{\ae} feed on species of mistletoe (<i>Loranthus</i>). They are gregarious on the underside of a leaf. They early stages of only a few species are known. The butterfly frequents grassy country and open woodland from 2,500 to 8,000 feet, rarely to 10,000 feet. It haunts flowering trees and shrubs, the male often abundant, but the female remaining at the tree-tops most of the time. The flight is slow and weak.</p>

<p><i>Mimicry</i>.&#x2014;All the species have the hind wing more or less brightly coloured on the underside, and in some cases there is also a striking colour on the upperside of the fore wing or on both wings. These patterns are probably all examples of warning coloration. A number of species are mimicked by other Pierid{\ae}, one by a Satyrid (<i>Elymnias</i>), and others by Nymphalids (<i>Mynes</i>). In India some species of the <i>bella-donna</i> group are closely resembled by <i>Prioneris thestylis</i> (Doubl.), and <i>Prioneris sita</i> (Feld.) is an excellent mimic of <i>Delias eucharis</i> (Drury).</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.&#x2014;Central and Southern China, Formosa, Hainan, Tibet, <span class="smallcaps">India</span>, South and East Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomons. No species has been found on the Key Islands, where the food-plant appears to be absent.</p>

<p>The genus contains 157 species so far recorded, and reaches its greatest development in New Guinea, where 67 species are known to occur, and where many more are likely to be discovered.</p>

<p>In the Indian area there are thirteen species comprising twenty-four subspecies.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> with white and grey-white stripes and spots as in <i>patrua</i> Leech, but more prominent. The stripes are narrower and the submarginal spots smaller than in the nominotypical form. Fore wing the a long and well-marked though slightly dusky cell-stripe; discal stripes in areas 4 to 6 usually connected with the submarginal spots; fringe purer white than in <i>patrua</i>.

<p>This race is only slightly differentiated from the nomino typical one.</p>

<p class="heading"><b>Delias sanaca</b> (Moore). (Fig. 120, genitalia).</p>

<p>This species differs from <i>lativitta</i> Leech in the broader or more diffuse cell-stripe of the hind wing, in the larger marginal spots, and in the shape of the stripe in area 4 of the hind wing. One form of <i>sanaca</i> is very like a form of <i>berinda</i> (Moore). In the more typical examples of <i>sanaca</i> the stripe in 4 of the hind wing is short and broad, with its proximal edge emarginate or straight. This character will not be very helpful in determining specimens from Burma, where the race <i>perspicua</i> Fruhst. is confusingly similar to <i>D. berinda boyle{\ae}</i> Butl. Specimens of the latter are lighter, especially on the hind wing, and the white stripe in area 1 <i>c</i> on the underside is not produced proximally of the stripe in 2. It is advisable to examine the uncus to be certain. The {\female} of <i>sanaca</i> has a prominent white cell-stripe on the hind wing upperside, and the other markings some what resemble those of the {\male}. In Burma specimens it is often difficult to know whether a given {\female} belongs to <i>sanaca</i> or to <i>berinda</i>. Examine the spots in areas 2 and 3 of the hind wing underside. In specimens of <i>sanaca</i> the distance between the distal edge of these spots and the inner edge of the submarginal spots opposite them is not greater than 4 mm. In specimens of <i>berinda</i> the distance mentioned is greater than 4 mm.

<p>{\female}. Fore wing yellowish-white, the proximal half only dusky on the veins. Hind wing as in the {\male}.</p>

<p>Form <b>confusa</b> Talb.&#x2014;Closely resembles <i>D. belladonna horsfieldi</i> Gray. Distinguished from the nominotypical form by the black ground-colour occupying a greater area than the with colour, so that the white discal stripes and spots are much smaller on the upperside, and to a less extent reduced on the underside.</p>

<p>{\female}. Lighter than the {\male} but darker than in the nominotypical form. <i>Upperside</i> of hind wing with reduced discal white patches, that in area 4 especially short; prominent black areas between the cell-patch and discal band, and between the discal band and submarginal spots.</p>

<p>The above is the first record of the {\female} of this form, and is made from a transfer recently presented to the British Museum by Lieut.-Colonel H. D. Peile, who found the insect dead on the ground at Mussooree, 5,500 feet, 1916, about May.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>.&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">North-West India</span>: common at Mussooree from April to June at about 5,000 feet; also known from Garhwal, and may be said to range from Kulu to Kumaon.</p>

<p>The identity of this race has been the subject of much speculation. No specimen is yet known which quite resembles the figure given by Donovan, or by Jones (Icones, pl. 37, fig. 2, unpublished), the latter figure being the original. It seems possible that the type came from Tong-king or Cochin-China, and the race from this area was treated by Talbot (1937) as the true <i>belladonna</i>. Confirmation is required by an examination of {\female} specimens from the area mentioned, but so far these are absent from collections. The race enters the Indian area in the Bhamo District of Burma.</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Somewhat resembles <i>hedybia</i> Jordan and <i>horsfieldi</i> (Gray), but is larger than these, and with the markings smaller than in the latter race. Hind wing <i>underside</i> with cell-spot minute or absent. The inner yellow area of the hind wing tends to be reduced.

<p><i>Early stages</i>.&#x2014;Not properly described. According to Fruhstorfer (1910) the larv{\ae} are red, ``each segment with long hairs, of which the lateral ones are black and the dorsal yellow. On young leaves of <i>Nauclea rotundifolia</i> Roxb.

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with markings ashy-grey; four subapical stripes in areas 4, 5, 6, and 8, their distal ends pointed and almost touching the margin; in area 3 a long broad stripe; in areas 2 and 1 <i>b</i>, a submarginal patch, the one in area 2 somewhat ovate, the one below it more square, and toothed on its proximal edge; a discal patch in the base of area 2, and a broad submedian stripe extending from the base to near the submarginal spot, are more bluish-grey; a bar in the end of the cell, anteriorly wider; two small spots in areas 4 and 5, placed against the cross-veins; usually an indistinct tornal spot on the inner margin. Hind wing with a large red basal area, its distal edge incurved in the cell. Distal dusky grey-white stripes well developed in areas 2 to 6, all more or less distally pointed, and proximally only divided by the veins; a short stripe in 7 almost touches the red proximal part of this area; a narrow bar across the end of the cell, adjacent to the stripe in area 4. Between the inner edge of these stripes and the red area is a broad band of blackish-brown ground-colour; a yellow inner area, the stripe in 1 <i>c</i> bright yellow, as also often the distal part of 2, with sometimes a distal spot of the same colour in area 3; area 1 <i>b</i> usually tinged ochreous.</p>

<p>{\male} <i>Upperside</i> white. Fore wing with costa narrowly black, and a small black apical area which extends on the margin to about vein 4, with usually some black scaling below this vein; sometimes the apical area is for the greater part bluish-grey, owing to the encroachment of white scaling. Hind wing white, except for some thin black marginal dusting in most specimens.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with black ground-colour, the veins very thinly streaked with white; a narrow discocellular white bar, three subapical white stripes, and four submarginal spots; the subapical stripes distally narrower and lightly dusted with black; the submarginal spots in areas 3 and 4 smaller than the others, and all less defined distally. Hind wing yolk-yellow; a broad subcostal red stripe in area 7, extending from the base of the area to the middle of costa, rest of the area black; area 5 black; costa edged with yellowish-white, and its base yellowish-white; an outer marginal black border which is deeply toothed on the veins; six submarginal spots of variable size, either yellow or white, divided proximally only by the veins, and with sharply defined proximal edge; below the cell, in the basal area, some dark scaling.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with black ground-colour; veins 1 <i>a</i> to 4 streaked with grey-white for their proximal two-thirds, as well as the upper and lower margins of the cell; some slight grey-white dusting over the basal half of costa and cell and below the ell; a sharply defined discocellular white bar which, on the lower vein, forms a rounded spot; seven submarginal white spots, of which those in areas 2 and 3 are always the smaller, the others subject to variation; the subapical spots in 5 and 6 each with a linear distal prolongation. Hind wing creamy- to yellowish-white, with a broad black marginal border which invades the light area between the veins as in the {\male} underside; a series of yellowish or greyish-white marginal streaks on the intraneural folds.</p>

Hind wing paler than in the {\male}, the veins streaked with white, which merges into the ground-colour; marginal black border wider than in the {\male}, with longer invaginations between the veins; yellow area more or less dusted with black, and a black steak along lower margin of cell; submarginal spots larger than in the {\male}, and usually more distinctly separated from one another.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}, 65-88 mm; {\female}, 80-90 mm.</p>

<p><i>Variation</i>.&#x2014; The species is subject to much individual variation within small limits. There is a light form in both sexes and two forms of female. Very rarely the hind wing sub-constal stripe is of a deep chestnut colour instead of red. In the {\female} the fore wing is sometimes without any vein-streaks, or these streaks are very large.</p>

<p>Form <b>leucacantha</b> Fruhst.&#x2014;This is much the commoner form. <i>Underside</i> of fore wing with strongly developed white vein-streaks and submarginal spots; hind wing with the submarginal spots usually white.</p>

<p>This species can be recognized by the hind wing beneath bearing a submarginal row of large brick-red spots. It is one of the best known species of the genus, and is an ornament among the butterflies inhabiting Ceylon and the plains of India.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white. Fore wing with all the veins blackened; a submarginal black line, anteriorly placed mid-way between margin and end of cell, angled at vein 5, and reaching vein 2 or the submedian; this line marks off a submarginal row of seven white spots and a linear apical mark; the three anterior spots are elongate, the fourth, in area 4, is short and narrow, the fifth and sixth more triangular, and the posterior one is square and large, not always clearly separated; these spots, excepting the lower one, are distally pointed or narrowed, and they touch or nearly touch the margin. Hind wing with a submarginal black line from vein 2 to vein 6, at veins 3 and 4 it is placed about mid-way between cell and margin;marginal area slightly pink from the colouring showing through from below; veins 1 <i>b</i> to 6 black from the submarginal line to the margin, and at the end of each is a small marginal black triangular spot, its base on the margin.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing white, and all the veins heavily blackened; submarginal line as on upperside, but much heavier; submarginal spots as on upperside, either all white or with the subapical two and the linear apical mark yellow. Hind wing with a submarginal heavy black line from the costa to vein 1 <i>b</i>; area proximally of the submarginal line yellow, with the exception of area 5 which is usually white, and area 6 which is sometimes partly white; there is a thin white distal edging to the yellow proximal area, except where the veins cross it; all veins blackened; marginal area occupied by a row of six large brick-red spots each edged with a dusting of dull white, and in shape somewhat square or subtriangular, the pointed distal end touching the margin; a small anal spot in area 1 <i>b</i>; the spots are only separated by the thinly blackened veins, and the marginal area between the spots is black. Fringes dull white, anteriorly on the fore wing blackened slightly between the veins.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> with all the veins heavily blackened. Fore wing ground-colour greyish dusky white; submar\'aginal line much heavier than in the {\male}, the spots a little smaller, the subapical ones with a yellowish tinge. Hind wing with veins 2 to 8 heavily blackened, more so in the proximal area; proximal area pale buff; veins 1 <i>a</i> and 1 <i>b</i> thinly darkened; a prominent row of six submarginal spots, white, tinged with pink, of similar size and shape to those of the {\male} underside.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> resembles the {\male}. Fore wing subapical spots yellow. Very dark specimens occur in which the light markings on the fore wing are much reduced. In some specimens the ground-colour of the fore wing is yellowish. Hind wing with veins slightly more blackened than in the {\male}; proximal area with area 5 only white at its distal end, and area 6 usually yellow.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}{\female}, 66-83 mm.</p>

<p><i>Scent-scale</i> (fig. 6 <i>f, g,</i> p. 15).&#x2014;Flask-shaped, very broad at the base, with a thick and scarcely tapering neck, which is furnished with fimbri{\ae} for half, or nearly half, its length; the disc rather large.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i> (fig. 133).&#x2014;Valve broad, with rounded apical edge, ventral edge slightly rounded, dorsal edge strongly excurved posteriorly. Uncus rather broad, with three small and well separated lobes; middle lobe triangular, larger than the lateral ones, which are short, narrow, and rounded.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p><i>Variation</i>.&#x2014;Much individual variation occurs on the underside (see Manders, 1912). The species has a restricted range, and so has not produced any subspecific form. A rare aberration occurs in which the hind wing spots are yellow instead of red.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Egg</i>.&#x2014;``The eggs are deposited usually on the upper surfaces of tender leaves of the mistletoe, one to several eggs being laid on the same leaf. Up to sixty-nine eggs have been found in a cluster on a single leaf. Even when thus deposited in a cluster, unlike most butterfly eggs, they are scattered irregularly. They stand vertically on the surface on one end, which is broad, or lie on one side. The egg is about 1&#x00BD; mm. high and about 1 mm. in diameter at the base. It is round, flask-shaped, being narrow at the top, which, however, does not end in a point but is concave. There are longitudinal ribs on the surface. The upper ends of the ribs run beyond and project to some extent beyond the rim of the concavity. The colour is yellow''(Ghosh, 1914).</p>

<p>The larva and pupa have been fully described by Bell (1912 <i>a</i>), and the following is taken from his descriptions:&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014; The larva, on emerging, eats the egg-shell, and then moves off, closely followed by the others, to the margin of the leaf, which is nearly always on old one, and never a very young one. They commence feeding side by side, finishing one leaf after another, until full-fed. The are always badly parasitized, generally by Diptera. They are sluggish in movement, and drop by a silk thread when disturbed, though not very readily. When about to pupate, each larva goes off by itself and attaches itself by the tail-pad and girdle to a horizontal or perpendicular surface.</p>

<p>Head round and somewhat flat, black, with a white line at the base of the jaws and mandibles; antenn{\ae} white, black-tipped. The body is coloured a greasy, greenish-yellow brown; second segment with anterior half white, and behind this a dorsal black patch; a lateral white line on segments 2 and 3; head sparsely covered with white hairs; segment 2 with six white hairs; a subdorsal row of long, white, erect hairs; a dorso-lateral and supraspiracular row of white hairs; body covered with small white tubercles bearing each a small, erect white hair; venter yellow. Length, 40 mm.; breadth, 6 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.&#x2014; Head rounded in front, the vertex bearing two subdorsal, cylindrical, round-topped, short tubercles, one on each side; a single central, short tubercles, one on each side; a single central, short and spherical, very short-pedicelled  tubercle, directed forward; segment 2 highly carinate in dorsal line, separated from segment 2 by a depression, short, with a broad and convex tubercle on the shoulder; abdomen swollen at segment 7, which is the stoutest part of the body; cremaster stout, triangular and down-curved; a dorsal row of pointed, conical, rather large tubercles on segments 6 to 11; a subdorsal row of much smaller tubercles on segments 2 to 12, and a supraspiracular row on segments 3 to 9. The surface is smooth, shiny, and of a slightly greenish light yellow; front tubercle of head, dorsal tubercles, and lateral tubercles on 6 to 9 shiny black; abdomen patched laterally with black on segments 10 to 12; sides, underside, and base of cremaster are marked more or less with black, and there are black marks on the wing-cases and underside of head. Length, 25 mm.; breadth, 7 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.&#x2014; The larv{\ae} feed on <i>Loranthus</i> growing on various trees, such as mango, sissoo (<i>Dalbergia sissoo</i> Roxb., Leguminos{\ae}), gula (<i>Ficus glomerata</i> Roxb. Morace{\ae})m etc., and are very largely found about March. The butterfly has been bred upon <i>Loranthus longiflorus</i> Descr., <i>elasticus</i> Descr., and <i>scurrula</i> Linn. The butterflies have been observed at Pusa and at Rangpur to visit mustard flowers in large numbers in November and December. They are weak fliers and flutter about, hardly ever flying straight. They rest with the wings closed over the back, are found on the wing in all weathers, and occasionally may be seen drinking at moist patches on roads and in river beds in the hot weather. The {\male} is said to have a strong scent, sometimes very strong, something like that of sweet briar.</p>

<p><i>Mimicry</i>.&#x2014;<i>D. eucharis</i> (Drury) is very closely resembled by <i>Prioneris sita</i> Feld. on both surfaces and in both sexes. The resemblance on the underside of the hind wing is very startling, and represents one of the best known examples. Both species were observed by Fraser (1931) at Lakati, flying together, the <i>Prioneris</i> in overwhelming superiority.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular India</span> as far as the lower slopes of the Himalayas. Abundant in Ceylon up to 4,000 feet, and elsewhere up to 7,000 feet.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: 40-55 mm.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.&#x2014;In the 1st and 2nd instars it is oily yellowish-green with a black head, and all the tubercles prominent and large in comparison with what they become later. 3rd instar dark green; venter much lighter, grey-green. Surface of body transversely impressed, with seven fine parallel lines to each segment, each interval between every two lines having a single central row of minute white tubercles, each tubercle bearing a short white hair or bristle; the main tubercles are but little larger than the others, and each bears a somewhat longer hair, which has often a globule of transparent clear liquid at its tip; the whote surface is clothed with extremely minute, brown, erect hairs; a frings of rather long, fine, white, erect hairs all round the body on the subspiracular and lateral ventral areas. 5th instar nearly the same as the 4th. Dark bluish-green, the venter light greyish-green. Length, 27 mm.; breadth, 4mm. (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913).</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.&#x2014;Cremaster narrow, square at the extremity, very shortly bifid. Colour of body dark bluish-or grass-green; wings greenish-white, as also the venter; segment 2 and top of snout whity-brown; thoracic carina similarly whity-brown, with a fine double black line along the summit, not continued anteriorly beyond the apex; carina of segment 4 similar in colour, and with a similar black line; flat portions of segments 6 and 7 whity-brown, the points of all teeth black; a yellow, supraspiracular, abdominal line along the narrow ledge. Length, 20 mm.; snout, 1.5 mm.; breadth, 7 mm. at segment 7 (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.&#x2014;The butterfly has been bred upon <i>Capparis aphylla</i> Roth., <i>C. sepiaria</i> Linn., <i>C. heyneana</i> Wall., and <i>C. horrida</i> Linn. f. These food-plants are found in all sorts of country. The eggs are laid singly anywhere on the food-plant; a favourite place is the top of a thorn. The cater-pillar always lies in the centre of the upperside of a leaf. The pupa is formed on the upperside of a leaf, sometimes on the underside, or upon a vertical surface as that of a tree-trunk or stone, etc. The imago emerges in about ten days, and remains quiescent for several hours afterwards if left undisturbed. The flight is fast and fairly strong, in more or less of a straight line. Fond of the sun and frequents open spaces near vegetation, coming frequently to flowers, and resting on or near the ground (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913).</p>

<p>Peile (1937) notes that the butterfly is common n the plains, being found about garden hedges. It occurs at Mussooree in the October migrations, and in Kumaon it is common up to 4,000 feet, June to October.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form</i> <b>remba</b> (Moore).&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. Resembles the wet form of <i>n. nadina</i>, from which it differs as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with distal half from middle of costa obliquely, to before the tornal angle, intense black, the base with a bluish shade. Hind wing with the distal area dusted with bluish-grey; outer margin anteriorly from apex to vein 4 decreasingly black.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> white. Fore wing with costal margin, and apex broadly greenish-yellow; a large, prominent, bright yellow subapical spot, below which is a large black irregular patch, angulate at, and touching, the lower apex of cell. Hind wing greenish-yellow, the veins black; a discal band of dense black irroration, its inner edge sharply defined and extended from costa through the cell to vein 1; the lower discal and tornal areas less densely dusted with black; a bright, greenish-yellow, irregular spot in the middle of area 6. Antenn{\ae} dark brown, head and thorax anteriorly with greenish-yellow pile; thorax in median and posterior areas with long bluish-grey hairs; abdomen black; beneath, the palpi and thorax yellow; abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> dark brownish-black. Fore wing with base of cell and upper basal half of area 1 white, densely dusted with black; apical half of cell, base of area 3, basal two-thirds of area 2, a submarginal large round spot in area 1, and a pretornal short stripe on inner margin, white. Hind wing with a more or less triangular central area white, its lower margin abruptly transverse, its base and posterior half dusted with black.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to the {\male}, but the distal dusky patch on fore wing larger and more prominent. Hind wing with more prominent dark irregular discal area.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form</i> <b>liquida</b> (Swinhoe).&#x2014;{\male}.<i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with restricted black area. Hind wing with narrow outer black border.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with costal margin and apex broadly dull ochraceous with a yellow tint, this colour on the apex margined on its inner side by an irregular dusky, blackish, subtriangular patch. Hind wing dull ochraceous with a yellow tint; an irregular dusky discal band that does not reach the costa nor inner margin.</p>

<p>{\female}. Darker than the {\male}, the <i>Upperside</i> with slightly extended black markings.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> marking paler and duller than in the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>.&#x2014;Spindle-shaped, with 12 longitudinal ridges, every two anastomosing before the apex and ending together in a single small tooth, the teeth forming a small ring round the top of the egg. Surface shiny, light yellow mottled with rosy red.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.&#x2014;Resembles <i>C. phryne</i> (Fabr.). The surface of body covered with small white tubercles, each bearing a short hair; a fringe of fine, rather long white hairs along the sub-spiracular and lateral ventral region. Length, 32 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.&#x2014;Resembles that of <i>C. phyrne</i> (Fabr.). Green or brownish-green, the flat dorsal parts and the snout and vertex of head yellow or brown; thoracic carina tipped with brown and edged with a thin black line; teeth of abdomen white, tipped with black; ventrally the prominent edges and the somewhat bulging wings are light green. Length, 17.5-20mm.; breadth, 7 mm. between the points of the teeth of segment 7</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913).&#x2014;The eggs are laid on a thorn, a leaf, or anywhere on the plant, generally near the ground. The larv{\ae} feed upon capers, as <i>Capparis heyneana</i> Wall., <i>C. moonii</i> Wight, <i>C. roxburghii</i> DC., and prefer shade. The butterfly is confined to the hills and regions of heavy rainfall. It is very active and somewhat devious in its line of flight, keeping a good deal to the thick underwood. Iit does not usually frequent flowers, and rarely rests on leaves in open places, so that it is not easy to catch. Found mostly in evergreen jungle, and does not rise to any great height above the ground.</p>

Hind wing white, with the veins black on the discal two-thirds; a marginal black border in which submarginal spots are either not detached from the proximal area or are detached by extended black, as in the more extreme wet forms.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> much darker than the upperside. Fore wing with the apical stripes and the submarginal spot in area 5 yellow. Hind wing with blackish-brown ground-colour, and prominent yellow markings, some of which may be edged slightly with white; a basal costal patch with black precostal vein, a broad cell-stripe, seven discal spots in areas 2 to 7, the one in 2 elongate, the one in 5 placed near the cell; a small spot in 7, above the cell; seven submarginal spots, the posterior two sometimes absent, the ones in areas 5 and 6 larger than the others. Antenn{\ae} black; head and thorax clothed with long bluish-grey pile; abdomen blackish; underside of palpi, head, and thorax black, of abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> deep brownish-black, with the following white markings, in addition to a broad sullied white area, distally suffused with yellow, which fills the basal three-fourths of areas 1 <i>a</i> and 1 <i>b</i> of the hind wing. Fore wing with a slender streak near base of cell, four spots at apex of cell as in the {\male} underside; two slender, somewhat curved streaks from near base of area 1, with a series of elongate discal spots in areas 2 to 6, and a submarginal series of elongate spots or short narrow streaks in areas 1 to 7, the streak in area 1 double; a short marginal streak before the tornus and a large subcostal spot produced outwards as an obscure slender streak in area 9.

<p><i>Dry-season form</i>.&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white, with a slight glaucous or greenish tint. Fore wing with the veins margined narrowly with black; outer margin with a narrow, black, strongly dentate border. Hind wing with the veins margined narrowly with black on the distal third; a marginal black line.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing white, costa black, apex suffused with yellow, all the veins from base broadly bordered with black that does not expand at the margin; an ill-defined, transverse, somewhat diffuse, post-discal black band from veins 1 to 7. Hind wing rich chrome-yellow up to a post-discal black band, beyond which the ground-colour is white with a series of large marginal vermilion-red rectangular or truncated cone-shaped spots; veins from base bordered somewhat narrowly but conspicuously with black. Antenn{\ae} brownish-black; head and thorax clothed with long bluish-grey haris; abdomen glaucous-white; underside of palpi and thorax greyish-white, abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female}. Similar to the {\male}, the black edgings to the veins of both wings on both sides broader. <i>Upperside</i> with the veins of both wings black to the base; both wings with a dusky black diffuse post-discal band.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with the cell traversed by three slender longitudinal black lines; the yellow and red markings brighter than in the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}{\female}, 80-90 mm.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form.</i>&#x2014;{\male}. Hind wing with a post-discal black heavy line; veins more heavily black, with triangular marginal spots. Fore wing with the veins more heavily black, and <i>underside</i> markings more darkened than in the dry form.</p>

<p>{\female}. Black markings heavier than in the dry form. Fore wing <i>upperside</i> often with three black lines in the cell, as on the underside. Apex more rounded than in the {\male}, and outer margin slightly falcate at vein 4.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.&#x2014;``Dull blue-green. Head and all the segments dotted with minute blue tubercles, those on the head and sides black-tipped; dorsal surface pubescent; a lateral fringe of soft white hairs below the spiracles'' (<i>Bell</i>, 1912).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.&#x2014;According to Bell (1912), this species inhabits the big evergreen jungles of the Western Ghats in Bombay, and generally keeps to the very tops of large and tall trees. The butterfly appears at about 8 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> and disappears after <span class="smallcaps">P.M.</span> It coomes to damp places on roads and in beds of rivers or streams in the hot days preceding the monsoon, and is fond of the sun. The female does not fly round the tree-tops nor comes to damp places. Larva feeds on capers. In Malabar it appears only during September to October (<i>Fraser</i>, 1930 <i>a</i>). In the Ghats it appears at the end of December, becomes plentiful in March, and occurs up to May, also occurring lower down in Coorg (<i>Yates</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mimicry</i>.&#x2014;<i>Prioneris sita</i> bears an extraordinary likeness to <i>Delias eucharis</i> (Drury). The latter is much commoner as a rule, and files all the year round. Fraser (1930 <i>a</i>) records that at Likati both species were in company, but the <i>Prioneris</i> in overwhelming superiority. Its flight is much more strong and swift than that of the <i>Delias</i>. It foregathers with <i>Catopsilia</i> and <i>Appias</i> on wet sand beside the river at Likati, where it is numerous in September.</p>

<p>The nominotypical form is that of the wet season, of which <i>auriginea</i> Butler is a synonym. The dry-season form is <i>lordaca</i> Walker.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form</i>.&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white. Fore wing with costal area to base of vein 11 dusky black; a prominent curved jet-black discocellular bar; a broad black apical area, narrowing to vein 2, its edge anteriorly straight to vein 4, and excurved in area 2; six white spots in the apical area, of which the anterior four are elongate. Hind wing with a marginal black border from veins 2 to 6, bearing four round white spots in areas 2 to 5.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing similar to the upperside, the markings more clearly defined and the apical spots larger. Hind wing yellowish-white, all the veins very broadly bordered with black; border with white spots as on upperside. Fringes white, alternated with black.</p>

<p>The ground-colour on both sides is variable. Upperside often cream-colour; underside sometimes wing, and the whole surface of hind wing varying to rich chrome-yellow.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}, but the black markings broader, the white apical spots of fore wing often partly obsolete on <i>upperside</i>. Antenn{\ae} in both sexes black, sparsely dotted with white; head, thorax, and abdomen white; thorax above often bluish-grey.</p>

<p><i>Expanse</i>: {\male}{\female}, 40-55 mm.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form</i> <b>lordaca</b> (Walk.).&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. Similar to the wet-season form, but on the <i>upperside</i> the black markings are narrower, the white markings on the apical area of fore wing broder and longer, and on the hind wing the white sub-marginal spots are larger and almost merge with the white ground-colour on the inner side.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with the ground-colour almost pure white, on the hind wing slightly yellowish.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1912):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>.&#x2014;At first white, turning later to orange.</p>

<p><i>Larva</i>.&#x2014;1st and 2nd instars oily yellowish-green, with each segment bearing a dorso-lateral hair which carries a globule of liquid at its tip. 3rd instar green, with a broad supra-spiracular purple-brown band. 4th instar greenish-ochreous, witha a broad supraspiracular band mottled with white, the region below it white enamelled with green, brown, and yellow blotches; a dorsal double green line; anal segment with two yellow vitreous tubercles, one on each side of dorsal line; body surface oily-looking, with the usal subdorsal, dorso-lateral, and supraspiracular tubercles, which are yellow, vitreous, and conical, each bearing a short brown hair which may exude a globule of liquid from its tip; a subspiracular tubercle, bearing a longish white hair; also many minute tubercles, each bearing a short fine white hair; a sub-spiracular fringe of rather long fine white hairs. 5th instar resembles the 4th instar; the purple band only dotted with the little white tubercles; the region below the band mottled greenish-brown; the broad greenish-ochreous dorsal colour finishes square at the hind margin of segment 12 or nearly so. Length, 35 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa</i>.&#x2014;Green, with a faint supraspiracular band; top of thoracic carina black behind, yellowish in front; end of snout yellow; the sides black, as also the shoulder-points and teeth of segment 7; tubercles all black; abdomen tinged yellow; wings marked with black; surface of abdomen pittled, Sometimes the colour of the pupa is greyish-bone, in which case the tubercles are bright yellow. Length, 23 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1912).&#x2014;The eggs are laid in clusters, up to 200 in a batch, on the young shoots or the undersides of young leaves. The larv{\ae} eat their way out near the top as a rule, and as often as not do not eat the egg-shell; they herd together during the first stages, but separate in the last; they are much subject to attack by parasites.</p>

<p>Pupation often takes place in company, one close up against the other on a perpendicular surface, or horizontal, on the upperside or underside of a leaf or against a stone or tree-trunk indiscriminately. The females of a brood emerge before the males.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a fairly strong flier; it prefers open places and hot sunshine, and flies low, being fond of resting on the ground with wings closed and, in dull weather, with the fore wings drawn down between in hind wings.</p>

<p><i>Food-plants</i>: Capers. Has been bred on <i>Capparis aphylla</i> Roth., C. <i>sepiaria</i> Linn., C. <i>heyneana</i> Wall., <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam., and <i>M{\ae}rua arenaria</i> Hook. f. &amp; Thoms.</p>

<p>Type of the genus, <i>A. zelmira</i> Stoll (=<i>libythea</i> Fabr.).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Fore wing with costa widely arched; apex acute or subacute, slightly rounded or slightly falcate, always more rounded in the {\female} than in the {\male}; outer margin straight; tornus well-marked; inner margin straight of slightly sinuous; cell always a little longer than half the length of the wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, well basad; 7+8 and 9 on a long stalk; 6 from the stem of 7+8 and 9; <i>mdc</i> usually about half as long as <i>ldc</i>. Hind wing more or less broadly pear-shaped; precostal vein long, curved distad from its base; <i>ldc</i> longer than <i>udc</i> or <i>mdc</i>. Antenna{\ae} about half length of fore wing or a little longer; club well marked and flatterned usually abrupt. Palpus with the third segment very slender and pointed, as long as or longer than the second. The {\male}, and sometimes the {\female}, with two long hair-pencils arising from the intersegmental membrane distad of the eighth abdominal segment; these hair-pencils are absent in <i>lalassis</i> Gr.-Sm.</p>

<p>Figure</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>.&#x2014;They are fast fliers. The males congregate in large numbers at wet places. Migratory swarms have often been observed. The female is strongly dimorphic and is usually much rarer than the male.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.&#x2014;The whote Indo-Australian region, extending to South, East, and West China and Africa. The Indian area contains ten species.</p>
