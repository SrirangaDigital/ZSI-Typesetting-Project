<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>C. calais</i> (Cram.) [=<i>C. amata</i> (Fabr.)]. {\male} Fore wing with costa very slightly arched; apex obtuse, rounded, slightly convex; tornus abtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly or moderately convex or sinuate, abou<span class="smallcaps">Sikkim</span>t three-fourths the length of costa; cell about half length of wing wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, emitted moderately close together; 7+8 and 9 stalked at more than half-way from end of cell to apex; 6 from upper angle of cell or from near base of stalk of 7+8 and 9; <i>udc</i> absent, <i>mdc</i> usually at least half as long as <i>Idc.</i> Hind wing with costa arched; apex rounded; outer margin slightly arched; tornus obtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly convex; cell not half length of wing; precostal vein long, bent distad; vein 7 from the cell well distad; 5 and 6 either from the cell separately or connate or stalked; <i>Idc</i> oblique, concave, usually more than twice as long as <i>mdc.</i> Antenn{\ae} short, not half the length of the fore wing, club abrupt and spatulate head tufted anteriorly; palpus with third segment short, slender, acute at apex; eyes naked; body moderately robust.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>The forms arranged under this genus, with the exception perhaps of those that belong to the genus <i>Eurema</i>, are, of all Pierid{\ae}, the most variable, seasonal and sexual dimorphism being very pronounced. As in <i>Ixias</i>, all transitions are found between the extreme wet-season and dry-season broods. The genus has its headquarters in Africa, where it is no less variable in India.</p>

<p>The species frequent hot and dry districts, and fly restlessly over the plains in the hot sunshine, or sail up and down rocky slopes. Many species are very abundant.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.&#x2014;North Africa; Africa, south of the Sahara; Palestine and Arabia to Persia, <span class="smallcaps">North-West Inala, Penin-Sular India</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> Over 60 species are known in the genus, and of these seven are found in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\female}. In two forms. One resembles the {\male}. and the other has a white upperside (<b>albina</b> Evans).</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;A truncated cone, with longitudinal channels, and fine, transverse stri{\ae}. White at first, turning yellow later.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;5th instar. Bright grass-green, with a broad white dorsal line, generally showing the transverse lines of the segments as slight depressions throughout its length; sometimes a fine light, very thin spiracular line. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The snout conical, equilateral, its base being reckoned as the whole pupal diameter at the front margin of segment 2; the real snout is only the very extremity of this cone, and it is very short. Cremaster nearly square, gently concave at the end, depressed dorsally between slightly prominent subdorsal ridges, slightly depressed ventrally between the rounded marginal ridges, each slightly prominent extensor-ridge ending anteriorly in a little point or sharp tooth; the suspensory hooklets are arranged in a dense mass all along the posterior margin. Colour green, with the lateral outline along the wings yellow. Length, 16 mm.; breadth. 3.5 mm.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid on the upperside of a leaf, there being from 50 to 60 in a batch.The larv{\ae} are gregarious, eat voraciously, and grow very fast. Eggs obtained on 25th July emerged next day; larv{\ae} pupated on 2nd August; imago emerged on 6th August. The caterpillars feed in rows along the edge of a leaf, lying close pressed one against the other, and continue thus up to the last stage, when they become more independent though still keeping in batches. Each larva goes off to pupate separately The first meal is the egg-shell. Food-plants: <i>Salvadora persica</i> Linn. and <i>S. oleoides</i> Decne., 
<i>Azima tetracantha</i> Lam., all of the family Salvadorace{\ae}.</p>

<p>The butterfly has a fluttering flight, fairly straight and horizontal. it does not often frequent flowers, and keeps usually near the ground, being fond of open sunny places. The food-plant grows especially in waste desert places.</p>

<p>In a brood of about 50 there will always be a couple of white females, and this seems to be quite independent of climate. in damp areas the black markings on the upperside are larger and more intense.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular India</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Bengal;</span> not rare.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> salmon-pink. Fore wing with costa black, thickly overlaid with greyish or pinkish scales; a black discocellular spot, which may be large and quadrate or smaller and lunate; outer margin broadly black, bearing a double series of spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots consists of a large spot in area 1 <i>b</i>, two very small spots in 2 and 3, one in each, and four large anterior spots placed in a curve; the spots in the outer series are variable in number, usually one in each area, and more or less linear in shape. Hind wing with a band of dense black specialized scales (androconia) on the costal margin, extended to just within the upper edge of the cell; this band joins a broad, similarly coloured marginal band of ordinary scales that becomes more or less diffuse posteriorly, and encloses a double series of small spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots is often obsolescent or sometimes absent; inner area heavily dusted with fuscous, extending to the disc, which has therefore generally a greyish appearance.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> greenish-yellow; an anticiliary fine black line on both wings; the black markings of the upperside show through. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot, variable in size and sometimes absent; a submarginal quadrate black spot in area ! <i>b</i>, and another (sometimes faintly marked or absent) further outwards in area 2; disc faintly and inner margin very broadly salmon-pink. Hind wing sparsely dusted with black; a small black discocellular spot. Cilia of both wings pale salmon-pink. Antenn{\de}, head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} speckled with white, the head and thorax covered with greenish-fuscous hairs; underside of palpi green, of thorax and abdomen white.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to that of the {\male}, but the ground-colour very much paler and more ochraceous than green. Some specimens have on the fore wing an anterior post-discal curved fuscous band. Hind wing with discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}, and annular; a curved discal series of reddish spots from costa to inner margin.</p>

<p>There is a symmetrical gynandromorph from Karachi in the British Museum (ex coll. Oberth\dd{u}r). </p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly, generally near the base of the plant on old leaves. White at first, turning yellowish, with three broad reddish lateral bands. Long, dome-shaped, with 16 to 18 longitudinal ribs, the points of twelve forming a low crown round the micropyle.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Segments 2, 13, and 14 somewhat more narrowed than those of <i>amata;</i> segments 4 to 12 stout and cylindrical. Early instars grass-green with an indication of a spiracular light line. Anal flap rather large, dorsally somewhat flattened, and somewhat flanged round the edges. The yellow spots on the body are minute tubercles. Final instar identical with that of <i>protractus.</i></p>

<p>In the first instar, according to Fraser (1911), the head is shining jet-black; body grass-green with crimson stippling laterally, which on the posterior three segments spreads upwards and meets that of the opposite side so as to form a more or less prominent crimson patch</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Rather stout, the snout shorter than usual in this genus, and somewhat bluntly rounded at the tip. A dorsal and lateral constriction behind thorax. Cremaster with the subdorsal ridges more clearly defined than in <i>amata.</i> Colour pinkish-bone, with a dark dorsal line and some dark marks on the dorso-lateral legion of abdomen as well as at the apices of wing-veins. <b>Fraser</b> (1911) notes that the pupa is ``identical with that of <i>protractus</i>, usually flesh-coloured and without markings.''</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Sind</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Baluchistan</span> and <span class="smallcaps">United</span> <span class="smallcaps">Provinces</span>, extending to the Persian Gulf; not rare.

<p><b>colotis fausta</b> (Olivier). (Fig. 160)</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> pale to deep salmon-buff. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot which is not connected with a dark costal border; a broad black distal border, narrowing posteriorly to a point at vein 2 or the tornus, and enclosing spots of the ground-colour; a series of small marginal spots. Hind wing with or without marginal black spots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with an oval patch of modified scales, placed in the proximal area above vein 1; this brand is more or less prominent on the upperside as a small raised spot.</p>

<p>{\female}. Dimorphic. one form resembling the {\male}, but without the sex-patch. Hind wing costal area on upperside not paler than the rest of the wing. The second form is white or partly white and partly salmon-buff.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Bottle-shaped, with 18 longitudinal ridges meeting in a thickened ring round the top. White at first, but soon turning yellowish, with three red irregular bands.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Rich green; sometimes a yellow narrow dorsal band, continued to the vertex; usually three large patches, light pinkish-brown with darker margins, in the spiracular region of segments 2, 8, and 11; sometimes there are eleven patches, which form a chain from segments 2 to 12. Lenght, 25 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The longitudinal axis of the body is quite straight from the tip of the short, conical snout to the end of segment 13. The cremaster is as long as segment 13, and is trapeze-shaped, narrowing backwards, the hind margin or extremity being very distinctly concave. Usually livid bone-colour; a black dot laterally near the front margin of each segment, and sometimes a larger dorsal one near the hind margin of segments 8 and 9; the pupa is sometimes light green with the lateral line faintly yellow. Length, 19 mm.; breadth, 5 mm. at the broadest part.</p>

<p>This subspecies is distinguished by the fore wing upperside having the marginal black area extended to the tornus. {\female} whitr.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> ground-colour almost orange-yellow. Fore wing with costa heavily dusted with black; discocellular spot large, not annular; apical and marginal area black, enclosing not more than three moderately large subapical spots and a series of minute marginal specks of the ground-colour. Hind wing with the marginal black spots rather large.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> more richly yellow than in the nominotypical form; fore wing markings dusky black, those on hind wing rose-pink.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> white Fore wing with basal and costal areas heavily dusted with greyish-blue; marginal border broad, and with three subapical spots as in the {\male}. Hind wing with black marginal border and white marginal spots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing white, sometimes with faint yellow suffusion; apical and marginal areas anteriorly light to dark ochraceous-yellow; discocellular spot very large; a broad post-discal, macular, dark reddish-brown band. Hind wing pale ochraceous-yellow, sparsely powdered with black; post-discal macular reddish-brown band as broad as the fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 45-55 mm.</p>

<p>The dry-season form is <b>rosaceus</b> (Butl.), of which <i>palliseri</i> Butl. is a synonym.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are laid separately, generally on an old leaf, sometimes on a dry twig or leaf-scar. The food-plant is <i>M{\ae}rua arenaria</i> Hook. f. &amp; Thoms., family Capparidace{\ae}, a climbing shrub confined to places where the vegetation is comparatively scanty, and to more or less desert localities.</p>
 
<p>The males fly fast, generally near the ground. They frequent flowers among the grass, as also do the females, which are less commonly seen. A sun-loving butterfly, characteristic of the plains and desert regions.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> (northern part) and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">Inaia;</span> not rare. Between Bombay and Kanara <i>fulvia</i> overlaps the range of <i>faustina.</i></p>

<p><b>Colotis etrida</b> (Boisduval).</p>

<p>A Indian species occurring in two races. To be recognized by its white ground-colour, the fore wing bearing an apical orange patch which is edged with black on the inner side.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Longer than broad, the apical third conical; eight longitudinal ridges, which are transversely striate. Surface shiny, at first yellowish and changing to reddish, caused by profuse blotching.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Resembles that of <i>Eurema hecabe</i> (Linn.), but the anal segment ends in two short and obscure knobs. A broad white spiracular band touched with orange above each spiracle, and bordered below by a slightly less broad pur-chocolate band; venter green. Length 19 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Also of the type of <i>Eurema hecabe</i> (Linn.). Snout slightly upturned, and cremastral extremity distinctly bifid. Ground-colour pinkish-bone; a prominent green-sepia band above the spiracular line from segments 6 and 7 to 13; a similarly coloured dorsal band from the head to the same segment; abdomen streaked with three similar light-coloured lateral bands. When the pupa is more strongly developed. Length, 18 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

 <p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}. <i>Upperside</i> of  fore wing with orange patch narrower; a small black spot in middle of area 1 <i>b</i>, and another in 3. Hind wing with marginal spots slightly larger.</p>
 
 <p><i>Underside</i> with apex of fore wing and whole surface of hind wing suffused lightly, or in specimens from very dry localities heavily, with ochraceous. Fore wing with spots in areas 1 <i>b</i> and 3 as on upperside. Hind wing with a discal, curved, almost complete series of fuscous spots; otherwise, as in the {\male}. In both sexes the antenn{\ae} vary from white to pale brownish; head thorax, and abdomen black, head and thorax with short greyish-brown hairs; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.</p>
 
 <p>The name <b>casimirus</b> (Butl.) (=<i>bimbura</i> Butl.) refers to specimens from dry localities, in which the orange patch is paler and the black markings obsolescent. On the <i>underside</i> the hind wing and apical area of fore wing are more or less ochraceous.</p>
 
 <p><i>Habits</i> (From <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&amp;The eggs are laid singly. Pupation nearly always on the underside of a leaf near the ground, so that the chrysalis is exposed to the soil or a dead leaf or other light object, and this probably accounts for the majority of those found being bone-coloured instead of green. The larva feeds upon capers, and has been bred most commonly upon <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam.</p>

<p><i>Tercolus eucharis</i> f. <i>pallens,</i> Fruhstorfer, 1910, p. 174.</p>

<p>This is very probably conspecific with two African forms.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> pure white. Fore wing with base and costa for a short distance generally sparsely dusted with black; a broad apical orange-yellow patch, with its inner edge straight and margined with gamboge-yellow; this patch is sometimes immaculate, but generally bears a black diffuse spot on its lower inner edge which may or may not extend to the outer margin below the orange; costa and outer margin bordered with black, which is much reduced in specimens from dry areas. Hind wing with marginal black costal spot.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> usually pure white, suffused except on disc of fore wing, with pinkish-yellow, and at base of same wing with pure sulphur-yellow; the orange patch and marginal black show through from the upperside, the former crossed by a sinuous fuscous band that ends in a black diffuse spot. Hind wing shaded with ochraceous at the base, and with a subapical fuscous costal spot, also a few scattered transverse fuscous stri{\ae} and small spots. Many specimens have the subapical spot continued as an obscure fuscous band across the wing, and bear a series of large marginal fuscous spots. Both wings with black discocellular dots. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen black; antenn{\ae} speckled with white on the  sides, bead and thorax clothed with short greyish-brown hairs; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with base and costa more heavily dusted with black; discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}; apical area black, with three enclosed elongate orange spots; inner edge of black area irregularly sinuate and diffuse, extended shortly inwards in area 3; a transverse black spot across the middle of area 1 <i>b.</i> Hind wing with sparse greyish-black basal dusting; subpical spot and marginal spots much larger than in the {\male;} sometimes there is an obscure transverse posterior discal band.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with markings much broader and more prominent than in the {\male;} the fuscous stri{\ae} and dots more numerous.</p>

<p>The dry-season form <b>aurora</b> (Cram.) (=<i>pallens</i> Moore) has reduced black markings, and the hind wing underside is rose-red.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 40-45 mm.</p>

<p>In the British Museum are 2 {\male}{\male}, probably of the dry season, in which the orange apical area is absent. They are creamy white instead of chalky-white; hind wing underside immaculate. (Bombay, 1887, January and November) (ex Coll. Swinhoe).</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Shape almost like a bell-jar, with 17 longitudinal ribs, some of which form a crown of teeth round the top; each rib is cross-rayed many times, producing a beaded appearance. Orange, with subcutaneous dull blotches.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>The tubercles of the body are comparatively large and conspicuous as compared with <i>C. dana.</i> Dark green to yellowish-green, with a light dorsal band generally present, body obscurely darker spotted; in some individuals there is a large, more or less triangular pinkish-brown white patch, including the spiracles of segments 6 to 8, the anterior one generally the smallest, increasing backwards, the largest never reaching the line of the dorso-lateral tubercles, and never extended posteriorly to farther than the centre of the segment. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Shape more like that of <i>Valeria</i> than other <i>Colotis</i> species. Snout conical and very rugose. Glaucous-green with a yellow shade, the whole surface vermiculate with little short, whitish lines; a yellow-white lateral wing-line from the shoulders, continued along abdomen to cremaster. The colour may be darker green or light yellowish-brown, marbled and blotched with white and darker brown. Length, 17 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly often on a dead thorn or twig. The larv{\ae} turn pink before pupation, and are much subject to the attacks of parasites, over 50 per cent. dying from this cause. The food-plant is usually <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam., a shrub common in waste places and hedges in the Deccan. The butterfly emerges in about a week.</p>

<p>The butterfly emerges in about a week.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a weak flier, keeping near the ground, and generally found in numbers near the food-plant to the flowers of which it is attracted. The male rests frequently on the ground, and likes the sun. The female is not often seen.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Central</span> <span class="smallcaps">India;</span> common.</p>

<p><b>Colotis dan{\ae}</b> (Fabricius).</p>

<p>This species resembles <i>etrida</i> (Boisd.), from which it can be distinguished by the apical patch of the fore wing being crimson, and in the {\female} this patch is traversed by a dark macular band.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Resembles in appearance a small <i>Hebomoia.</i> Usually glaucous-green, with many indistinct whitish spots or short lines; a broad spiracular white line, which may be bordered above by plum-colour or brown-orange. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Stout, with a short, thickly conical head process, a prominent ventral wing-bulge, and thorax moderately humped. Green or bone-colour, with slight marblings and transverse lines, which in the green form may be absent.</p>

<p>Length, 15-16 mm.; breadth, 4.5 mm. at the shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">Sind</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Baluchistan</span> and Persia; extending to Africa south of the Sahara. Two subspecies in the Indian area</p>

<p>This subspecies is very variable, especically in the {\female.}</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white, the base of wings dusted with black. to a variable extent, and sometimes not at all. Fore wing with or without a minute discocellular black spot; apical area broadly carmine, edged proximally and distally with black, both edges meeting on the costa and outer margin, and sometimes extending as a black line to the tornus. Hind wing with marginal black spots, varying in size and sometimes reduced to more or less obsolescent, unconnected dots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> white. Fore wiing with base of cell washed with sulphur-yellow; discicellular spot as on upperside; an ochraceous-pink apical patch, not margined with black, but similar in shape and position to the patch on the upperside, and sometimes more or less suffused with greyish; this patch is crossed near its inner edge by an obliquely placed series of four or five spots that vary in colour from pale ferruginous to black, in some specimens there are two marginal diffuse black spots, one each at the ends of veins 2 and 3. Hind wing sometimes pure white, but usually suffused with ochraceous-pink to a greater or less extent; a small discocellular spot, pale ferruginous to black, sometimes annular and centred with carmine; a discal, curved, macular band, varying from pale ferruginous to black, the posterior spots often obsolescent or entirely absent; a series of marginal black vein-dots which are sometimes connected by a fine marginal line. Antenn{\ae} pale brown, speckled with white; head, thorax, and abdomen black; head and thorax anteriorly clothed with brown, sometimes greyish-black hairs; underside of palpi thorax, and abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> white, the base of wings more or less heavily dusted with greyish-black, sometimes extended as a broad band parallel to the inner margin of the hind wing. Fore wing with carmine patch smaller than in the {\male}, sometimes reduced to a row of pale, rosy, subapical streaks, but always bordered distally, and generally proximally also, by black of varying width; sometimes the inner black border is very narrow, in others broad, and in a very few entirely absent; discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}, a post-discal, anterior, macular, curved black band, the upper spots of which cross the carmine area, or where this is reduced it crosses the black proximal edging; a black, transverse, somewhat diffuse spot in area 1 <i>b</i> and 2. Hind wing with a dusky discocellular spot; a discal, black, macular, curved band, more or less incomplete; marginal black spots, sometimes connected to form a continuous band. All these markings are generally diffuse.</p>

<p>The name <b>taplini</b> (Swinhoe) refers to an extreme dry-season form with much reduced black marking, and the <i>underside</i> with apical area of fore wing and entire hind wing reddish-ochraceous. An intermediate form is <i>sanguinalis</i> (Butler), and this name should be applied to the dry-season form as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on an old leaf or its stalk. Larva turns pink before pupating. it is much subject to the attacks of parasites, and the pupa is attacked by flies. The pupal stage lasts about a week.  The food-plants are capers, and the butterfly has been bred on <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam., <i>Capparis sepiaria</i> Linn., and <i>C. divaricata</i> Lam., also on <i>M\{ae}rua arenaria</i> Hook. f. &amp; Thoms.</p>

<p>With the exception of the male of <i>C. fausta</i> (Oilv.) the butterfly flies straighter than other Indian species of the genus. It keeps to the ground, and is never found in the jungles and regions of heavy rainfall. Both sexes are found in about equal numbers.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">India;</span> not rare. According to Evans (1910) the butterfly is common in the Palni Hills from April to June and August to October.</p>

<p>A peculiar and uncommon species which hitherto was recorded only from Africa. It may be mistaken for a small specimen of <i>eucharis</i> (Fabr.), but the apical area of the fore wing upperside is orange, not orange-yellow, and on the underside of this srea there is an orange subapical band.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white. Fore wing with broad apical orange area reaching to vein 2 at the margin; this area is edged along its outer and costal borders by a black line that is very slightly produced to shirt streaks at the veins, and is usually thickened at about middle of the costa and at vein 2; the inner edge of the orange area is without black scaling, and is evenly defined; there is no discocellular dot. Hind wing usually with small triangular black marginal spots on the veins, but these are not constantly present; basal area more or less dusted with black; no discocellular dot.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> white. Fore wing with a subapical orange band, which is sometimes not very distinct, formed of short bars in areas 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8; apical area pale yellow or buff, extending slightly proximad of the orange band, and occupying the same area as on the upperside; some slight basal black scaling. Hind wing white, yellowish or pinkkish, without markings except for the costal edge, which is yellow or orange along the basal fourth or more, and for some slight black dusting over the proximal area</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> of fore wing without a black marginal line, but with short marginal vein-streaks more distinct than in the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with a slight black discocellular mark, and sometimes a small spot of sparse black scaling in the post discal area below vein 2. In other respects similar to the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>I phias</i>, Boisduval, 1836, p. 595.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>H. glaucippe</i> (Linn.).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Fore wing triangular; costa arched; apex more or less acute; outer margin oblique, slightly sinuate; tornus well marked, obtuse; inner margin bisinuate; cell slightly more than half lenght of wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, close together, running almost parallel for most of their length; 7+8 and 9 on a long stalk; 6 from the cell, forming a short <i>udc; mdc</i> about half the length of <i>idc</i>, which is angled. Hind wing suboval, broad; apex and tornal angle boldly rounded; precostal vein long, bent sharply distad. Antenn{\ae} not more than half the length of fore wing, club gradual; eyes naked, prominent; palpi somewhat flattened, scaly, clothed with stiff hairs anteriorly and at the apex, third segment short and oval; thorax and abdomen robust; legs slender.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i> (from <i>Klots</i>, 1931).&#x2014;Penis without a basal prong; saccus slender, about as long as tegumen; uncus short, curved, bifurcate; a well chitinized area immediately beneath base of uncus and above anus; juxta well developed, hollowed out; valve with a dorsal and a distal process; harpe of medium size, with a dorsal point.</p>

<p>The <i>Hebomoia</i> are the largest Pierids found in the Oriental Region. The males usually fly in the morning, frequenting the edges of paths and woods and open thickets, coming also to <i>Lantana</i> flowers; during the hotter hours they settle on moist sand. The females are sluggish and remain in the thickets.</p>

<p>The species of this genus like those of <i>Ixias</i> and <i>Colotis</i>, Possess a brightly coloured apical area on the fore wing upperside, whilst the underside of hind wing and apical area of fore wing possess a cryptic coloration. In <i>Hebomoia</i> these characters are more strongly developed than in the two other genera. When at rest the underside blends well with the surroundings, as the proximal area of the fore wing is covered by the hind wing, the margin of which adjoins the apical area of the fore wing.</p>

<p><b>Hebomoia glaucippe</b> (Linn{\ae}us)</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> white or yellow, the latter colour only found on the hind wing in one Indian race. Fore wing with apical half black, bearing a large orange patch which usually enters the end of the cell; the extension of the black area proximally of the orange patch is variable, and is often absent in specimens from dry areas. Hind wing with a few anterior marginal black spots or sometimes a very narrow marginal black border.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with proximal area white; apical area mottled brown or reddish. Hind wing similar to apical area of fore wing; a prominent deep brown or blackish line from base to outer margin, passing through middle of cell.</p>

<p>{\female}. Similar to the {\male}. <i>upperside</i> of fore wing with smaller orange patch, the black spots on its distal part enlarged and often cutting off a series of submarginal orange spots; proximal area often yellowish, with black basal dusting.

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Body with the dorsal half-segments convex, the ventral ones flattened; anal segment projecting over the anal claspers, narrowed, truncate, with a slight indentation in the centre of extreme margin. Body glaucous-green, lighter in the spiracular region, with a beaded, white, subspiracular line from segment 13 to the head; the lower half of the beads on this line is orange except on segment 3, where it is blue; through each one of the transverse tubercles (eachrow of such reaching to the spiracular line on each side) runs a short, longitudinal, purple line. Length, 47 mm., breadth, at segment 3, nearly 8 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The shape is that of <i>Catopsilia.</i> Head process conical at base, cylindrical anteriorly, slightly up-turned at tip, and very rugose. Cremaster narrow-triangular, bifid at end, extensor ridges rugose, strong and ventral. Ground-clour dark yellowish-green; dorsum and a lateral headband purple; a large dorsal spot on segments 4, 5, and 9. Length, 37.5 mm.; breadth, 9.4 mm. at the shoulders.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on the upperside of a leaf, usually on an old one close to the ground. The newly-hatched larva eats the egg-shell. The larva pupates on the underside of a leaf well hidden near the ground or close to the stem. The food-plants are Capparidace{\ae}, the larva being commonly found on <i>Crat{\ae}va religiosa</i> Forst. f., also often upon the large climber <i>Capparis moonii</i> wight.</p>

<p>The butterfly has a very strong and powerful  flight. it is fond of the sun, often rests on the ground, goes to damp places, and comes freely to flowers. When at rest on the ground among leaves or rubbish the insect is quite invisible, the colour and pattern blending so well with the surroundings.</p>

<p>This genus is closely allied ti <i>Eronia</i> Butler, the species of which are found throughout Africa. The two genera are apparently connected by <i>V avatar</i> (Moore), which by pattern and genitalia approximates to <i>Eronia.</i></p>

<p>The males are bluish-white to bluish-green, with the veins blackened on both sides, more so on the upperside, where there is a tendency to the formation of a striped pattern. A distinctly striped pattern is found in the females, which are black, with stripes and spots of green, white, brownish or yellow. They resemble Danaines very strongly, not only in pattern but also in flight. The female may be monomorphic, dimorphic, or trimorphic, the pattern in each case resembling particular Danaines found in the same locality.</p>

<p>Resemble <i>V hippia</i> (Fabr.) in colour and disposition of the markings, but differs as follows:&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> ground-colour of a deeper blur. Fore wing with outer black border much broader generally, without submarginal spots, or only one or two present. Hind wing with outer black border very broad, narrowing slightly to the tornus.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in <i>hippia.</i></p>

<p>{\female}. Closely resembles the {\female} of <i>V hippia</i>, but on the <i>upperside</i> the outer black margins beyond the discal markings on both wings are proportionately much broader, the submarginal spots placed further from the margin.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with marginal black borders broader and darker, the submarginal spots on apex of fore wing and on hind wing absent or very indistinct and blurred. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen in both sexes much as in <i>V hippia.</i></p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i>{\male}{\female}, 65-80 mm.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form</i> <b>fraterna</b> (Moore).&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> with narrower black borders and less heavy vein-streaks.</p> 

<p><i>Underside</i> with the outer borders scarcely less darkened than the rest of the wing, and black markings on fore wing much smaller.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> markings broader and more bluish. <i>Underside</i> of fore wing with apical area bluish; hind wing bluish, the outer border darker, and submarginal spots prominent.</p>

<p>The name <b>pingasa</b> (Moore) may be used to denote a large form of the extreme wet-season type in which the black ground-colour is greatly extended.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are deposited usually in evergreen jungle at above 100 feet. They are laid singly, and often very close to the ground. Pupa attached to the underside of a leaf or thin twig. The food-plant is <i>Capparis heyneana</i> Wall.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a strong flier, but keeps to the shade of the underwood. The female may be found more often at rest than the male; it does not usually frequent flowers, and is never found at water. The female is never found flying in the same way as the male and is generally seen fluttering around in the underwood, looking like a <i>Danaus aglea</i> (Cram.).</p>

<p><b>Valeria valeria</b> (Cramer, 1776).</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. A. S. Corbet for some enlightenment on this species, which he is investigating. <i>V valeria</i> can be divided into two groups, which may be termed the <i>Hippia</i> and <i>Valeria</i> groups. These groups are especially distinguished by the form of the genital armature. The valve is furnished with a small ventral process which is apparently the harpe. In the <i>Hippia</i> group this process is well rounded and broad ventrally, and projects beyond the edge of the valve. The {\ae}deagus is strongly curved posteriorly. In the <i>valeria</i> group the harpe is long and narrow, does not project ventrally, and is directed dorsad, lying entirely within the valve. The {ae}deagus is straight or only slightly curved, and is anteriorly broader than in the <i>hippia</i> forms. Only the <i>Hippia</i> group is known to occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male} <i>Upperside</i> bluish-white, paler than in <i>ceylanica</i> (Feld.).</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> also whiter; all the veins strongly defined by black. Fore wing with submarginal spots which are also well marked on the underside of both wings.</p>

<p>{\female} Dimorphic in the Indian subspecies, and trimorphic in some other areas. The principal form resembles <i>ceylanica</i> (Feld.), but is whiter, with more prominent submarginal spots. The second and rarer form has the hind wing upperside with yellow discal area</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014; A pointed oval, the apex crowned with a circle of 7 or 8 small, pointed teeth; 17 longitudinal, minutely beaded ribs. White at first, and later with four bands of faded rose Laid. in batches of six and over on the upperside of a leaf. (Colonel Coleridge, who has bred <i>hippia</i>, saya that the eggs are laid in batches of four and more, <i>teste</i> Peile, in MS.).</p>

<p><i>Larva</i> and <i>pupa.</i>&#x2014;Closely resembling <i>p. ceylanica</i> (Feld.), the larva less marked. The food-plant is <i>Capparis heyneana</i> Wall.</p>

<p>The butterfly does not frequent heavy jungle, and likes the sun.</p>

<p>The habits of the {\female} are thus described by Fruhstorfer (1910):&#x2014; ``The females by their sluggish flight resemble the Danaids to such an extent that in Tenasserim I was constantly taking them for <i>Danais grammica</i>, often as they had already deceived me. In Sumatra and Java the yellow females mimic the likewise yellow <i>Danais aspasia</i> and <i>philomela</i>, but yellow females also occur in South India, where there is no yellow Danaid model.''</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">India</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span> and Hainan, south to Flores and the South Philippines. A number of subspecies, of which only one occurs in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>C. crocale</i> (Cramer).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Fore wing elongate; costa regularly and widely arched; apex moderately acute; outer margin short, slightly concave; tornus obtuse; inner margin long, about four-fifths the length of costa; cell less than half the length of wing; vein 11 from the cell well basad; vein 10 from near end of cell; 7+8 and 9 on a long stalk; 6 from the stem of 7+8 and 9 at about a third from end of cell to apex; 5 from the cell, with <i>mdc</i> oblique and at least half as long as <i>ldc.</i> Hind wing very broad; costa strongly arched; apexnot well marked; outer margin very slightly arched; tornus angular, well marked; inner margin almost straight from base, slightly concave near apex; cell short and broad; <i>mdc</i> and <i>ldc</i> slightly oblique, the latter attenuate in its upper half; precostal vein short, curved slightly basad; vein 8 strongly angular near base. Antenn{\ae} short and stout, not half lenght of fore wing; club long and gradual, truncate at apex. Palpus with third segment short and oval</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>Male with secondary sexual characters. Fore wing underside, near base of inner margin, with a long hair-pencil directed forwards; hind wing upperside, in area 7 near the base, with an oval patch of androconia.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia.</i>&#x2014;Penis long and curved, bearing chitinized teeth, and with a long basal prong; saccus thick, shorter than the tegumen and uncus combined; tegumen short, usually with a mid-dorsal lobe; uncus slender, free part long; valve with a rounded dorsal process, and an angulate, somewhat rounded distal process (from <i>Klots</i>, 1931). The genus agrees with <i>Colias</i> in the long basal prong of the penis, the short saccus, and the dorsal lobe of the tegumen.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The species are very common and sometimes congregate in swarms. Migratory flights often take place, and 75 per cent. of the individuals are males, but the females often lay eggs during migration. Both sexes are easily caught at flower, where they settle to rest the wings closed; they are also partial to wet places. The larv{\ae} are sometimes in such numbers as to constitute a pest.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole Indo-Australian Region and Africa; allied groups are found in South America. Five species are found in the Indian area.</p>

<p><b>Catopsilia crocale</b> (Cramer).</p>

<p>The question whether this species and <i>pomona</i> (Fabr.) are or are not conspecific remains still a puzzle to lepidopterists. In the Indian area there is no difficulty in separating them, but in the Malayan islands, and in Australia and New Guinea, the characters, so constant in India, become intermixed, and much difficulty is experienced in separating the two forms. It is true that no difference can be found between the male genitalia of <i>crocale</i> and <i>pomona</i>, but this is not a proof of their conspecificity. They are not seasonal forms of one species, for both occur throughout the year in the same area. Corbet (1937 <i>a</i> p. 50) in Malaya observed that specimens found <i>in copula</i> were always <i>crocale</i> &#215; <i>crocale</i> and <i>pomona</i> &#215; <i>pomona.</i> Large collections of lar{\ae} from a single <i>Cassia</i> bush produced all <i>crocale.</i> Corbet remarks: `` I feel certain that <i>pomona</i> and <i>crocale</i> are not conspecific in Malaya, whatever may be the position in more easterly parts of their range.''</p>

<p><i>C. crocale</i> can be distinguished by the characters given in the key. In other respects the species is very variable In the Indian area two forms of each sex can be distinguished.</p> 

<p>A good account of the two species in Sumatra is given by Dr. Martin in de Nic\'eville &amp; Martin 1896, pp. 357-555.</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;White at first, turning yellow later.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Bright green, with a dark dorsal line and a spiracular broad white line suffused with yellow on segments 2 to 5; tubercles green, frequently dark metallic blue, increasing in size towards the spiracular region where they often form  a broad supra-spiracular band; in individuals with blue tubercles the head tubercles are also blue. Length, 41 mm.; breadth, 5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Of the normal smooth type, with slight ventral wing-bulge and tail suspension. Snout conical, continued smoothly and evenly into the outlines of the head. Cremaster a truncated triangle as broad at the base as it is long, much hollowed out ventrally, with low, dorsal, parallel extensor ridges. Colour green; tip of snout, edge of cremaster, and supra-spiracular line along abdomen, yellow. Length, 28 mm.; breadth, 7 mm. at segment 7; snout, 2 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on the upperside of a leaf or on a bud or shoot. The larva lies along and over the midrib. It is able to jump, and can clear a space of several inches. It is able to jump, and can clear a space of several inches. It can exude a green, rather strong-smelling liquid from the mouth when attacked; this may be the reason why it is less liable to parasitic attack than many others of the family. The species has been bred on most species of <i>Cassia</i>, upon <i>Bauhinia racemosa</i> Lam. and <i>Butea frondosa</i> Roxb.; the favourite, however, is <i>Cassia siamea</i> Lam.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a fast flier, rises high in the air, and can cover long distances; the flight is straight, in powerful, long, up-and-down curves.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole Indo-Australian Region from South China to the Solomon Islands. Only the nomino-typical race occurs in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;``The head is round, green, clypeus edged with brown, covered with small shiny black tubercles which do not hide the colour of the head; the anal flap is rounded, but looks square at the extremity, and is covered with rows of small black tubercles of which only the row along the spiracular line is conspicuous. The spiracles are oval shiny, and white.

Length, 51 mm.''</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;``The pupa is the same as that of <i>C. crocale</i> at first sight, but the dorsal line of the thorax is absolutely parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pupa for two-thirds of its length, consequently the hind part just before the margin is perpendicular to this part, <i>i</i>, <i>e.</i>, is raised suddenly but very slightly above the front margin of segment 4, and the front end of this parallel dorsal line is at an angle, and a sharpish angle, with the front slope of the thorax the cremaster is distinctly bifid at at the extremity, and hassome shiny, very stout, black suspensory hooks dorsally as well as at the extremity. There is a dorsal rugose black tip to well as at the extremity. There is a dorsal rugose black tip to the snout terminating the head, which snout is cylindrical in its apical half; there is no black line round the eye as in <i>C. crocale</i>, and there is a dark green-blue dorsal line which is yellow on the thorax as well as the supra-spiracular yellow line. Length, 34 mm.; length of snout, 3 mm.; breadth at segment 7, 9 mm.; height at apex of curve of wings (segment 6), 10 mm.; height at the apex of the thorax, 8 mm.''</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing white; costa edged with black; outer margin with a narrow black border, wider at the apex, its inner edge dentate, from apex to tornus, and of nearly even width throughout. Hind wing rich cadmium-yellow, slightly paler towards the base, usually with small marginal black spots towards the veins.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> rich cadmium or chrome-yellow. Fore wing with the posterior area below the cell and vein 2 pure white, the yellow, however, extends down to the tornal angle in a curve. Both wings with a discocellular spot, pinkish and ringed with darker brownish-pink; similar spots on the hind wing usually in the base of the cell and in areas 7 and 5, and below the origin of vein 2; usually a post-discal series of lunular diffuse markings of similar brownish-pink scales. Antenn{\ae} and upperside of head reddish-brown; thorax clothed with fuscous-grey hairs, abdomen yellow; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen yellow.</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing dull creamy white, marginal black broader; a post-discal series of illdefined diffuse black spots curved strongly inwards anteriorly; often a small discocellular diffuse black ring. Hind wing as in the {\male}, the yellow of a duller shade that turns to pale pinkish-white towards basal area above the cell; a post-discal series, sometimes obsolescent, of dull brownish-black lunular markings; marginal spots much larger and duller in colour than in the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in the {\male}, but all black markings of upperside replaced by rich pinkish-red tints.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> chalky-white or greenish. Fore wing with apical and marginal narrow black border; a black discocellular spot which may be absent Hind wing either unmarked or with a marginal series of black vein-dots or spots which may form a continuous line.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of hind wing and anterior part of fore wing pale ochraceous mottled with brown strig{\ae}.</p>

<p>{\female}. As in the {\male}, but black margins a little broader. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot and black costal border;</p>

<p><i>usually</i> a short anterior, post-discal, macular black band, <i>Underside</i> usually with prominent discocellular ring-spots.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Spindle-shaped, narrowly truncate at the top; 12 longitudinal ridges which, however, do not form teeth at the top, although they all reach the edge. White at first, turning yellow.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Very similar to that of <i>crocale</i> except that there are tubercles on the venter. Dark gras-green, the head lighter, and venter of a green which is between the two.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The counterpart of that of <i>crocale.</i> Head produced into a short, perfectly straight snout, short and pyramidal in shape. Dark green, lighter on venter; a yellow dorsal line on thorax; a similarly yellow supra-spiracular line from end to end. Length, 22.5 mm.; breadth, nearly 6 mm. at segment 7.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;South China to Australia and the Pacific. Four subspecies, of which the nominotypical one is found in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> chalky white, slightly tinted in some specimens with green. Fore wing with a discocellular black spot; costa edged with black; an outer marginal black border, wide at the apex and narrowing slightly to the tornus, its inner edge slightly produced on the veins. Hind wing with marginal black vein-dots or with a continuous narrow border.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> greenish, with reddish-brown strig{\ae} and small discocellular spots.</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}, all black markings broader, and discocellular spot on fore wing larger. Fore wing with an anterior, short, black, post-discal band, sometimes much widened and partly or completely coalescing with the marginal border. Hind wing with a marginal narrow black band; usually some anterior post-discal spots.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in the {\male}, the discocellular spots better defined, with an outer red ring that encircles a silvery spot; hind wing with one or two similar spots on each side of the discocellulars. Both wings with a post-discal series of reddish-brown spots. Both sexes with antenn{\ae} reddish, head and thorax anteriorly brown, thorax  clothed posteriorly with long white hairs abdomen white; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 50-70 mm.</p>

<p>The name <b>minna</b> Herbst applies to a form, typically {\female}, in which the <i>upperside</i> of fore wing bears a heavy post-discal line, and the <i>underside</i> of the hind wing is more greenish, and is without discocellular or other spots. Apparently an extreme wet-season form.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913).&#x2014;The food-plant is usually <i>Cassiatora</i> Linna.; the larva feeds also upon other leguminous plants, and in the Deccan the chif one is <i>Cassia auriculata</i> Linn. The butterfly is not quite such a powerful flier as <i>crocale</i>, and keeps nearer to the ground as a rule.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span>, <span class="smallcaps">India</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Andaman</span> <span class="smallcaps">Islands</span>, extending to Hainan, Formosa, and South China, south and east to Borneo, Java, Celebes, and the Philippines. Rare in the Andaman Islands, but common elsewhere in the Indian area.</p>

<p><b>Catopsilia florella</b> (Fabricius, 1775).</p>

<p><i>C. florella</i> (Fabr.) and <i>C. pyranthe</i> (Linn.) are very closely allied, and in India they often present forms which are very similar and difficult to separate. If there are two species, <i>C. florella</i> must be considered as an African one which has extended its range eastward. The nominotypical race is very common over the African continent, and is easily distinguished from the Indian race; an intermediate subspecies is found in Arabia. Seasonal dimorphism is not very marked. </p>

<p>It appears very possible that is only the dry-season form of <i>pyranthe.</i> The dated specimens in the British Museum were taken from December to April, whilst those of <i>pyranthe</i> were taken from June to October. Although I have followed Bingham in keeping these separate, I am rather disposed to think they are seasonal forms.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> white. Fore wing with or without a black discocellular spot; outer marginal reddish-brown or blackish spots which are free or connected only at the margin.</p>

<p>Hind wing <i>underside</i> as in <i>pyranthe</i> (Linn.), but with larger discocellular spots having prominent silvery centres.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> yellow to white. Fore wing with prominent discocellular spot.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in the {\male}, the markings reddish-brown and more prominent.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> pale yellowish-green.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> creamy-white. Hind wing with discocellular spot prominent, not dark-edged.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Verity</i>, 1909):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Cylindrical-conical, with four longitudinal ribs. At first yellow, becoming darker, with the apex black.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;The young larva is uniform dark green. When full-fed it is thin, elongate, cylindrical, slightly flattened dorso-ventrally; anal plate spread over the two end segments. colour dull green, darker dorsally, the upper surface minutely tuberculate, the tubercles black, and stripe, its upper edge merging with the ground-colour; spiracles ringed with dark green; head lighter than the rest of the body. Length, 45-50 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Bright apple-green; a longitudinal whitish stripe on the sides of the abdomen; sparsely dotted with black and marked with fine strig{\ae}; region of head, base of wings, and anal extremity tinged with reddish.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are deposited one at a time on the underside of the leaves, and hatch in about 15 days. When not feeding the larva rests on a bed of silk in the middle of the upperside of a leaf. The pupal stage ordinarily lasts from 10 to 15 days, but it is supposed that many pup{\ae} lie dormant during the cold season. The larv{\ae} feed upon various species of <i>Rhammus</i>, and rarely upon <i>Vaccinium.</i> </p>

<p>The butterfly is usually everywhere common and frequents all types of country where the food-plant may grow. In Europe it hibernates during the winter.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole Pal{\ae}arctic Region, except the Canary Islands, extending to Japan and the Liukiu (or Riu Kiu) Islands,south to <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Himalayas</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Baluchistan.</span> Four out of the eight known subspecies occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> pale, clear cadmium-yellow. Both wings with marginal reddish-brown vein-dots, and cilia of fore wing reddish-brown from vein 4 to apex; a deep orange discocellular spot on both wings, the spot on the hind wing the larger.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> pale yellowish-green, fore wing with posterior discal and basal areas usually sulphur-yellow; discocellular spots on both wings dull ferruginous. Antenn{\ae}, palpi, and head above reddish-brown; thorax with dull yellowish-grey hairs; abdomen above black, yellow on the sides; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen yellowish-white.</p>

<p>{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> pale creamy-white; reddish-brown markings and discocellular spots as in the {\male}.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i>{\male}{\female}, 60-70 mm.</p>

<p>The butterfly is very variable within narrow limits, and the literature is burdened with many names given to these insignificant European forms. There is a tendency to gynandromorphism, and many such examples have been recorded; these are usually the result of breeding, but faked examples are not unknown in collections. The larva is much subject to the attack of hymenopterous parasites.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>G. harina</i> (HOrsfield), from Java.</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Wings broad, somewhat rounded, the {\male} without sex. patches. Fore wing cell not quite half the length of wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell; 7+8 and 9 stalked; 7+8 as long as the distance from end of cell to the fork of 7+8 and 9; 6 from the stem of 7+8 and 9 at about a quarter the distance from end of cell to apex of wing; <i>mdc</i> at least half as long as <i>ldc.</i> Hind wing with precostal vein rather thin and directed basad; vein 7 from well before the end of the cell; <i>udc</i> and <i>mdc</i> about equal in length, slightly shorter than <i>ldc.</i> Antenna short, club gradual; palpus short, third segment short and oval.</p>

<p>This genus is a monotypical one, and bears a close though superficial resemblance to <i>Eurema.</i> The development of the precostal vein, the position of vein 7 of the hind wing, and the distinctive genitalia combine to render this genus sufficiently distinct from <i>Eurema.</i> The species frequents woods and likes the shade, whilst <i>Eurema</i> is usually found in more open country and likes the sun.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>E. daira</i> (Godt.).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Fore wing with costa arched; apex generally more or less rounded, in a few forms acutely pointed but not produced; outer margin straight; tornus rounded; inner margin bisinuate, very long, about seven-tenths the length of costa; cell not quite half the length of wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, the former given off just before upper angle of cell; 7+8 and 9 short, the stalk long; 6 from the stem of 7+8 and 9, nearer the fork of these veins than to end of cell; <i>mdc</i> more than half as long as <i>ldc</i>, both incurved. Hind wing broad, broadly oval or slightly pear-shaped; costa arched; apex and outer margin continuous and strongly curved; tornus obtusely angular, the angle distinct; inner margin broadly arched; cell short, broad at apex; precostal vein absent or very greatly reduced; vein 7 from or from just before end of cell; discocellular veins not oblique; <i>udc</i> very short; <i>mdc</i> less than half as long as <i>ldc;</i> <i>ldc</i> incurved. Antenn{\ae} short, not heavily scaled, club gradual; palpi not very hairy, third segment short. {\male}. or without patches of androconia. One group has on the fore wing underside a narrow elongate brand above and below the basal part of vein 3. Another group has a small patch on the hind wing upperside at the base of vein 7, and a similar patch on the fore wing underside at the base of area 1 <i>b.</i></p>

<p>The species of this genus are small, the fore wing not exceeding about 28 mm. in length. The genus contains a great number of very distinct species which may be assembled into groups on secondary sexual and other characters. Some species closely resemble one another, especially <i>hecabe</i> (Linn.) and <i>blanda</i> Boisd., but the genitalia afford good distinguishing characters. The Indo-Australian species have been the subject of an excellent revision by Corbet and Pendlebury, and their results are largely followed here.</p>

<p>The butterflies are slow fliers. They are found everywhere in the tropics in open places, in gardens and about the edges of woods. They are attracted to wet places and often congregate in swarms.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole Indo-Australian Region, including China and Japan, throughout Africa south of the Sahara, and over the whole of South America and in parts of North America. Ten species are known to inhabit the Indian area.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">L{\ae}ta</span> Group (<i>Nirmula</i> Moore), p. 517.</p>

<p><i>Brigitta</i> Group.</p>

<p>The nominotypical rare of the species from which this group takes its name is confined to Africa. It was found by Corbet (1934) to be conspecific with the forms previously classed with <i>libythea</i> Fabr. Corbet (1933) pointed out that <i>libythea</i> Fabr. was preoccupied by <i>Appias libythea</i> (Fabr.), so, therefore, this name can no longer be used in <i>Eurema,</i> as it is a primary homonym, both having been described originally as <i>Papilio.</i></p>

<p>The group is reresented in the Indo-Australian Region only by the species <i>brigitta</i> (Cramer).</p>

<p><b>Eurema brigitta</b> (Cramer, 1780).</p>

<p>Besidea the characters mentioned in the key, it can be added that the fore wing is more elongate and narrowed towards the apex than in other species of the genus, and the black outer border is well marked and not excavated. The {\male} clasper of this species possesses five hook-like appendages which have the same arrangement in both the Indian and African races.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole {\AE}thiopian and Indo-Australian Regions, extending north to Formosa and South China. A single subspecies in the Indian area.</p>

<p>The seasonal forms of this race are not so well marked as in some other species of the genus.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> gamboge-yellow. Fore wing with apical third and outer border black, the inner edge of this area more or less regularly incurved from costa to inner margin, and slightly toothed on veins 1 <i>a</i> to 3; basal area dusted with black. Hind wing with a black outer border that is broader anteriorly; basal area dusted with black. Specimens of the wet season have broader black areas than those of the dry season; sometimes in the latter the marginal band of the hind wing is broken into linear spots posteriorly.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of similar ground-colour. Fore wing with costa narrowly edged with pink; two well-marked discocellular spots and some obscure subapical black specks. Hind wing with a spot at the base, followed by three transversely placed spots and an elongate, delicate, loop-like discocellular spot black; above and below the discocellular spot are small diffuse black spots; post-discal short diffuse black bands placed <i>en \'echelon.</i> Both wings black marginal vein-dots; cilia salmon-pink. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen dusky black, the thorax with some yellow hairs; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen whitish-yellow.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}, but the black marginal borders proportionately broader in both seasonal forms.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 30-40 mm.</p>

<p>The name <b>rubella</b> (Wall.) applies to the dry-season form, and the form of the wet season may not deserve a name.</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Grass-green, with a darker green dorsal line, and on segments 2 to 12 a white spiracular band tinged with yellow. Length, 19 mm.; breadth, 2.6 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Snout short and conical; cremaster square at the end, flat dorsally and slightly thickened at the extreme posterior corners. Body green, with a white spiracular band, a subdorsal and lateral brownish spot on each segment, a large spot in front of the spiracle of segment 7, a group of seven lateral spots in front of the spiracle of segment 2; snout pink and wrinkled. Length, 16 mm.; breadth, 2.7 mm. at shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly generally on the uppersides of the leaves often on the young folded leaf-buds. The food-plant is <i>Cassia kleinii</i> Wight &amp; Arn., a rather small annual growing in damp places.</p>

<p>The butterfly is very plentiful in dry weather in the hot rocky beds of rivers in Kanara, where the willow-like <i>Homoia</i> grows. It keeps much to the bushes close to the ground; in certain places it congregates amongst the undergrowth. Flight weak and not sustained. Fond of flowers near the ground.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span>, <span class="smallcaps">India</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Nicobar</span> <span class="smallcaps">Islands</span>, extending to South China; very common.</p>

<p><i>L{\ae}ta</i> Group.</p>

<p>A small group of two or, perhaps, three species confined to the Indo-Australian Region, one species occurring in the Indian area. This species exhibits well-marked seasonal dimorphism, and it is now known that <i>venata</i> Moore, previously considered distinct, is the wet-season form of <i>l{ae}ta</i> Boisduval.</p>

<p><b>Eurema l{\ae}ta</b> (Boisduval).</p>

<p>To the characters given in the key it can be added that the apex of the fore wing is more pointed than in other Indian species of the genus, especially in dry-season specimens. Seasonal dimorphism is so strongly marked that the two forms <i>l{\ae}ta</i> and <i>venata</i> werw considered to be distinct species until, in 1931, Colonel Mosse proved them to be conspecific</p>

<p>Both wings in the wet-season form with well-developed black borders, not much indented. In the dry-season form the border on the fore wing does not usually reach the tornus, and on the hind wing it is reduced to apical spots or is absent.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of hind wing in both forms with a more or less distinct and more or less complete oblique post-discal diffuse band from apex to inner margin, in dry-season specimens much more distinct and reddish.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span>, <span class="smallcaps">India</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Burma</span>, north to China, Japan, and the Amur, south to Hainan, Tong-king, Annam, Java, Philippines, Timor to Kei Islands. Apparently absent from the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. Two subspecies in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form</i> <b>venata</b> (Moore) (fig. 172 <i>b</i>).&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> gamboge-yellow. Fore wing apical third black, this colour extended along the costa in a gradually narrowing line to the base; inner edge of black outer border oblique and sinuate from middle of costa to vein 4, thence continued outwards along that vein for a short distance and vertically downwards to vein 2, thence obliquely outwards to the tornal angle; the portion of the area between veins 2 and 4 of even width, slightly produced angularly inwards at veins 2 and 3; basal two-thirds of wing dusted with black, most dense at extreme base; a black linear discocellular speck. Hind wing with an outer even black border; an area of black dusting from base to tornal angle, not spreading on to the disc nor reaching inner margin; a small patch of salmon-coloured androconia at base of area 7. Cilia of both wings pale yellow.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with somewhat duller ground-colour. Both wings evenly but sparsely dusted with black, not extending to the disc, cell, nor dorsal margin of fore wing. Fore wing paler yellow; a patch of salmon-coloured androconia below the median vein in area 2; a linear discocellular speck. Hind wing with a black dot in area 7; two very obscure, parallel, short, blackish post-discal bands. Both wings with marginal black vein-dots. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen dusky black; underside of antenn{\ae} with a line of white dots; palpi, thorax, and abdomen whitish.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the male. Both wings with denser black dusting and broader outer black borders; on fore wing the border narrowed generally abruptly below the muddle of area 1 <i>b</i>, and continued thence to tornal angle as a mere line; on hind wing very broad anteriorly and attenuated rapidly towards the tornus.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in the {\male}.</p>

<p>The names <i>santana</i> C. &amp; R. Feld., <i>vagans</i> Wall. &amp; Moore, <i>rama</i> Moore, and <i>cingala</i> Moore are synonyms of <i>venata.</i></p>

<p><i>Dry-season from</i> <b>l{\ae}ta</b> (Boisd.) (fig. 172 <i>a</i>).&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. Fore wing much more pointed at apex outer margin sharply cut and straight. <i>Upperside</i> a richer brighter yellow. Fore wing with basal half of costa broadly dusted with black; outer black border stopping abruptly at vein 2; the tornus, except for a very fine black anticiliary line, yellow. Hind wing with black border reduced to a black subapical patch and posteriorly to a series of black spots, or latter or all these markings absent</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of both wings with pale yellow ground-colour. Fore wing with apical area and basal half of costa dusted with fleshy pink and brownish scales. Hind wing densely shaded with fleshy pink and brownish; two post-discal, somewhat diffuse, straight, ferruginous-brown bars, the inner one the longer; above these bars are a few brown, somewhat obscure specks and dots on upper basal part of wing. Antenn{\ae} mealy yellow, with scattered dusky scales; head with pinkish pubescence; thorax and abdomen black, with scattered yellow hairs and scales; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen pale yellowish-white.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 30-40 mm.</p>

<p>Various transitional form occur between the extreme wet and dry forms.</p>

<p>Colonel Mosse (1931) succeeded in breeding both forms from a single batch of eggs laid by a <i>venata</i> {\female}. The seven specimens studied included two <i>venata</i> (one of the typical dusky type, the other approximating to <i>l{\ae}ta</i>) and five <i>l{\ae}ta</i> (two with hind wing underside yellow, two with hind wing underside brownish-buff, one with hind wing underside creamy-buff, the commonest form).</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Wet-season from.</i>&#x2014;Not rare in the Bombay presidency in the drier parts. It is common round Belgaum, in Dharwar, Bijapur sholapur, and Poona in grass-lands. Always keeps close to the ground and hardly ever flies far witout settling. Flight weak and fluttering. Fond of flowers, which the male seeks amongst the grass, generally on the very surface of the ground.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form.</i>&#x2014;Flight weak but not fluttering. Fond of resting on dead grass-stems and blads; the pinkish yellow colour of the underside blends very well with the withered surroundings. In Kanara it appears about October, about the end of the monsoon, and is quite common from November to June. It is more abundant than <i>venata.</i></p>

<p>It should be mentioned that Bell strongly suspected <i>venata</i> to bethe wet form of <i>l{\ae}ta.</i></p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Sikkim</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Burma;</span>
very common, Also in Hainan, Tong-king, Annam, Siam, and Java.</p>

<p>Hecabe Group. (Fig. 173, genitalia).</p>

<p>The males of this group may be recognized by the narrow grey sex-brand placed on either side of the median vein, on the fore wing underside, form the base to the origin of vein 2. Fore wing in both sexes with outer black border continued to the tornus and except in dry-season forms, excavated between veins 2 and 4. The group contains eight species inhabiting the Indian area.</p>

<p><b>Eurema blanda</b> (Boisduval), 1836.</p>

<p>The species is sufficiently characterized in the key. The female is often extremely like <i>hecabe</i> (Linn.), female, in having a broad, deeply excavated margin on the fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i> (fig. 173 (3)) (Corbet &amp; Pendlebury, 1932, p. 153, fig. 3).&#x2014;Valve posteriorly with four appendages, of which three are simple, rather slender, slightly curved, spine-like processes, whilst the fourth is broad, flat, and larger than the others. A fifth simple appendage is situated in the interior of the valve as in <i>hecabe</i> and <i>simulatrix.</i></p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (as observed in <i>E. blanda davidsoni</i> (Moore), from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Very similar to that of <i>hecabe</i>, but is always found in companies of many individuals. Body dorsally of a dark blush-green, with a pale yellowish-green, often somewhat indistinct, spiracular line; venter yellow-green. When not quit full-grown the colour is greenish-yellow over. Length, 26 mm.; breadth up 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Resemble that of <i>hecabe</i>, but is dark yellowish green brown with top of snout yellow; snout sharply pointed and often slightly upturned at the end. The pip{\ae} are almost invariably found strung up in companies, one behind the other, along the underside of a twing or midrib of a leaf.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid on the upperside of a leaf or young shoot in clusters of 20 or 30 each. The lar{\ae} are gregarious and much subject to the attack of hymenopterous parasites. The food-plant is <i>Wagatea spicate</i> Dalz. (family Leguminos{\ae}), a large climber with long spikes of orange and red flowers, a striking object in the jungle-landscape of the Bombay Western Ghats. The larva also feeds upon some species of <i>Cassia</i> and upon <i>Delonix (Poinciana) regia</i> Raf., the gold-mohur tree. The butterfly flies high up round trees.</p>

<p><i>It will be seen that this race of <i>blanda</i> has received many names, indicating its great variability. I am unable to find any constant characters for retaining any of these names, but the following summary may be useful to those who wish to investigate the variation:&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><b>E. b. rotundalis</b> (Moore) (fig. 175) applies to the dry-season form Ceylon, of which <i>uniformis</i> (Moore), <i>templetoni</i> (Butler), and <i>citrina</i> (Moore) are wet forms.</p>

<p><b>E. b. davidsoni</b> (Moore) applies to the wet form in Peninsular India.</p>

<p><b>E. b. heliophila</b> (Butler) (fig. 174 <i>c</i>) applies to the wet form from the area Sikkim-Assam-Burma, <i>grandis</i> (Moore) being an extreme wet form from Assam with very broad borders.</p>

<p><b>E. b. roepstorffi</b> (Moore) applies to the dry form in the Andamans, <i>cadelli</i> (Moore) being the wet form.</p>

<p>The oldest name for the wet-season form appears to be <b>uniformis</b> (Moore).</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form.</i>&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> rich citron-yellow. Fore wing with black outer border rather broad in the apical area, narrowing posteriorly and strongly excavated below vein 4, resembling <i>hecabe</i> (Linn.). Hind wing with a marginal narrow black line which may be interrupted, or increased to a narrow band.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with slightly paler ground-colour. Markings much as in dry-season specimens of <i>hecabe</i>, but fore wing always with an additional minute reddish-brown dot at extreme base of cell, and in all typical specimens the apical reddish-brown patch is much large and spreads diffusely outwards to the margin.</p>

<p><i>Wet-season form</i> <b>uniformis</b> (Moore).&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with broader black border. Hind wing with a narrow black border, wider in the {\female}.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> markings more distinctly defined than in the dry form.</p>

<p>The extreme wet form of {\female} has very broad borders on both wings, and the fore wing has a prominent discocellular mark. Hind wing with a diffuse but strongly dentate edge to the black border. A specimen in the British Museum from Travancore has white ground-colour, only the anterior half of hind wing being yellow.</p>

<p><b>Eurema hecabe</b> (Linn{\ae}us, 1758).</p>

<p>This widely distributed species is the most variable <i>Eurema</i> in the Indo-Australian Region, and many names have been bestowed upon its variations. Transitional forms are so common that most of these names represent no constant form, and cannot properly be recognized now.</p>

<p>Normally the species has two cell-spots on the fore wing underside, but examples with no cee-spots are not uncommon; specimens with a single cell-spot or with three cell-spots are rare. The male can be easily separated from its congeners by the sex-brand on the fore wing underside; this is absent but rarely. The {\female} resembles the {\male}, but a white form of this sex occasionally occurs.</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i> (fig. 173 (1)) (Corbet &amp; Pendlebury, 1932, p. 152, text-fig. 1).&#x2014;Valve with five rather long, slender, slightly curved, spine-like appendages. The anterior one, situated in the centre of the valve, is not always prominent.</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (as observed in <i>simulata</i> (Moore), from <i>Bell</i>, 1913):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Spindle-shape, the top bluntly pointed; many very fine longitudinal ribs, and many fine transverse stri{\ae}. White when laid, quickly becomeing yellow.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Dark green, mostly glaucous on the sides, with a spiracular narrow white band from head to end of anal flap. Length 22 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Like that of <i>E. libythea rubella</i> (Wall.). Snout conical, not long, rather sharply pointed. Cremaster rather longer than broad, strong, trapeze-shaped, the nearly square extremity, as well as the adjacent ventral surface, set with short suspensory hooklets. Usually green, with a rather dark violet-grey dorsal line; dorsal margin of wing also violet-grey, this colour continued along abdomen above spiracles; a faint white spiracular line; the line of suture of wings near abdominal end dark. Some pup{\ae} are much marked with smoky grey, especially on the wings Length, 17 mm.; breadth 3.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habita.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on young shoots and leaves. Larva feeds upon Leguminos{\ae}: <i>cassia, Wagatea, Acacia, Serbania, C{\ae}salpinia, Albizzia</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a stronger flier than the others and keeps on the wing for some time, often ascending high in the air It comes freely to flowers, and frequents damp places in the hot months, being equally abundant in the shady extensive forests of the hills and in the open hot plains.</p>

<p>According to Manders (1910)the food-plant in Ceylon is usually the ``Madras Thorn,'' <i>Pithecelobium dulce</i> Benth.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;The whole {\AE}thiopian Region and the whole Indo-Australian Region, northwards to Korea and Japan. Five subspecies occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p><i>Wetseason form.</i>&#x2014;{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> yellow, variable in tint from sulphur- to rich lemon-yellow according to locality, with a light or heavy rainfall. Fore wing with a deep black outer border, continued narrowly along costal margin to base; inner edge of the border from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, excavated between vein 2 and 4, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins, and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies the whole of the tornal angle; the inner edge of this projection is normally slightly incurved. Hind wing with an outer narrow black border which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; thisborder varies in width, and its inner edge is sinuate; inner margin broadly paler than the ground-colour.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> ground-colour usually paler than that of the upperside, with the following reddish-brown markings:&#x2014; Fore wing two small spots or specks in basal half of cell, and a reniform discocellular spot or ring. A sex-brand on both sides of the median vein, extending from the base of wing to the origin of vein 2; this brand is broader than in any other Indian species of the <i>hecabe</i>-group. Hind wing with a slightly curved subbasal series of three small spots; a discocellular, slender, irregular ring or spot; a post-discal series of highly irregular curved streaks, some or all of which are often obsolescent; the streak in area 7 is out of line with the others and directed to mid-way between these and the discocellular spot. Both wings with minute reddish-brown costal and outer marginal vein-specks. Antenn{\ae} greyish-yellow, club black; head, thorax, and abdomen yellow, shaded with fuscous; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen yellowish-white.</p>

<p>{\female}. Black marginal borders slightly broader, the inner edge of the band on hind wing often diffuse. <i>Underside</i> as in the {\male}.</p>

<p>The form <b>lacteola</b> (Dist.) is white.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form.</i>&#x2014;{\male}{\female}. <i>Upperside</i> very similar to wet-season specimens, the hind wing border sometimes narrower and diffuse inwardly.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to that of the wet-season form, but the spots larger, more clearly defined darker, and therefore far more conspicuous; often with greater or less black dusting. Fore wing with a subapical, very prominent, elongate spot or short bar of reddish-brown extended downwards from the costa; this spot is irregular in shape and of variable also a small reddish-brown spot in area 1 <i>b</i> near the tornus.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i>{\male}{\female}, 40-50 mm.</p>

<p>The nominotypical <i>hecabe</i> Linn{\ae}us is restricted to the Philippine Islands (Luzon), and is represented by the figure in Petiver, 1702-11, `Gazophylacii natur{\ae},' Pl. 28, fig. 9. This insect is in the Petiver Collection in the british Museum.</p>

<p><i>Papilio rahel</i> Fabricius may belong to <i>hecabe</i>, but the type is not known, and the description is quite insufficient to make identity certain.</p>

<p>The names <i>hecabeoides</i> M\'en\'etries and <i>{\ae}siope</i> M\'en\'etries. apply to <i>hecabe</i> forms, but they do not appear typical of Indian and came probably from China.</p>

<p>This race is slightly differentiated from <i>toba</i> de Nic\'eville, from Sumatra.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> lemon-yellow as in <i>toba.</i> Fore wing very much like <i>andersom</i> Moore, and differing from <i>toba</i> and the nominotypical race in having the inner edge of the black border below vein 2 curved distad to near the tornus. Hind wing with the black marginal border narrower than in <i>toba</i> and with only a slight linear dusting. A specimen from Rangoon and another from Tong-king have a much narrower border on the fore wing, whilst the hind wing has only a faint marginal dusting.</p>

<p>{\female}. Specimens from Burma resemble the {\male}. Those from the Malay Peninsula have a broader black border on both wings; on the hind wing the border is almost as wide as in the nominotypical race; the inner edge of this border is diffuse.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 27-37 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Burma</span> and Tong-king to the Malay Peninsula; very rare. 1 {\male}, Dawna Range, April (ex Coll. Fawcett); 1 {\female}, Karen Hill Tracts, October, 1924 (ex Coll. Archibald); also Rangoon, 1 {\male}; Tenasserim, 1 {\male}; Toungoo, 1 {\female}.

<p><i>Terias kana</i>, Moore (part.), 1907, p. 69, pl. 573, figs. 1 <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> ({\male}{\female}).</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> deep bright yellow, markings as in <i>hecabe</i>, but marginal border more intensely black and with broader apical area; the inner edge of the excavated area, between veins 2 and 4, is directed towards the distal margin at point just above the tornus, a character not found in other Indian <i>Eurema.</i></p>

<p><i>Underside</i> paler. Fore wing with a single cell-spot, a discocellular spot, a broad, dark brown streak at the tornus, and a large quadrate spot covering the apical area. Hind wing marked as in <i>hecabe</i>, but the circular cell-spot is obsolete, the markings all faint and ill-defined. The sex-brand is pale, long, and narrow as in <i>blanda.</i></p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}, but hind wing border broader and more diffuse.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 40-45 mm.</p>

<p>Fig. 182 <i>a</i>, reproduced from Bingham, represents a from of which no specimen exists in the British Museum. It is remarkable for the absence of the marginal band on the hind wing.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Dawna Range</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Southern Burma</span>, extending to the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and North Borneo; not rare.</p>

<p>{\male}. <i>Upperside</i> bright yellow. Fore wing with outer black border which extends from just beyond middle of costa to tornus, and continues along inner margin to base; the inner edge of this border is fairly regular, and the veins which traverse the basal part of the border are yellow. Hind wing with narrow black outer border, which becomes broader and more diffuse towards the tornus.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> rather paler than the upperside, the markings much sparser than in <i>hecabe.</i> Fore wing with a single mark in the cell, the usual discocellular spot, and faint apical markings recalling <i>andersoni.</i> Hind wing marked as in <i>hecabe</i>, but the cell-spot is either missing or very faint, and the discal markings are reduced to spots. The sex-brand is long rather narrow, and prominent</p>

<p>{\female}. Resembles the {\male}, but hind wing <i>upperside</i> with a broader marginal border.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 40-45 mm.</p>

<p>Type <i>C. hyale</i> Linn{\ae}us, 1758.</p>

<p>{\male}{\female}. Fore wing with costa arched at base then almpst straight to apex; apex obtuse; outer margin slightly convex; tornus obtusely angulate; inner margin straight, about three-fourths the lenght of costa; cell about half length of wing; vein 11 from the cell; veins 7+8, 9, and 10 stalked, 7+8 and 9 on a long stalk; vein 6 from above the origin of 10; <i>mdc</i> short, about half or less than half length of <i>ldc, idc</i> incurved. Hind wing broadly oval; cel more than half length of wing; precostal vein absent or minute; <i>mdc</i> and <i>ldc</i> oblique, the latter much the longer and incurved.

<p><i>Colias</i> is one of the oldest genera in the Pierid{\ae}, and can be traced back to the tertiary Age. It agrees with <i>Catopsilia</i> in certain features of the genitalia. Sexual dimorphism is well developed in some species, and some females are dimorphic. Variability is very great, and numerous individual forms  have received names. About 56 species are known, comprising a great many subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;Central Asia and over the whole Pal{\ae}arctic Region generally, extending to the whole of North America and along the Andes; also distributed over Africa, It occurs in <span class="smallcaps">South India</span>, the <span class="smallcaps">Himalayas</span>, South China, and Formosa, but is absent from the rest of the Indo-Australian Region.</p>
