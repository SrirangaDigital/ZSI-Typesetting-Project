<p>{\female} The band is orange, and the cell of fore wing more or less black.</p>

<p>This race is more constant than is usual in <i>pyrene</i>.</p>

<p>In the race from the Andamans the band on the fore wing is orange</p>

<p>The specific distinctness of this species, separated from <i>pyrene</i> by Bingham (1907), has been recently confirmed by Corbet (1937). No differences in the genitalia or scent-scales are to be found in the two species, but they occur together and the pattern is sufficiently distinct.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>C. calais</i> (Cram.) [=<i>C. amata</i> (Fabr.)]. {\male} Fore wing with costa very slightly arched; apex obtuse, rounded, slightly convex; tornus abtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly or moderately convex or sinuate, about three-fourths the length of costa; cell about half length of wing wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, emitted moderately close together; 7+8 and 9 stalked at more than half-way from end of cell to apex; 6 from upper angle of cell or from near base of stalk of 7+8 and 9; <i>udc</i> absent, <i>mdc</i> usually at least half as long as <i>Idc.</i> Hind wing with costa arched; apex rounded; outer margin slightly arched; tornus obtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly convex; cell not half length of wing; precostal vein long, bent distad; vein 7 from the cell well distad; 5 and 6 either from the cell separately or connate or stalked; <i>Idc</i> oblique, concave, usually more than twice as long as <i>mdc.</i> Antenn{\ae} short, not half the length of the fore wing, club abrupt and spatulate head tufted anteriorly; palpus with third segment short, slender, acute at apex; eyes naked; body moderately robust.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>The forms arranged under this genus, with the exception perhaps of those that belong to the genus <i>Eurema</i>, are, of all Pierid{\ae}, the most variable, seasonal and sexual dimorphism being very pronounced. As in <i>Ixias</i>, all transitions are found between the extreme wet-season and dry-season broods. The genus has its headquarters in Africa, where it is no less variable in India.</p>

<p>The species frequent hot and dry districts, and fly restlessly over the plains in the hot sunshine, or sail up and down rocky slopes. Many species are very abundant.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.&#x2014;North Africa; Africa, south of the Sahara; Palestine and Arabia to Persia, <span class="smallcaps">North-West Inala, Penin-Sular India</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> Over 60 species are known in the genus, and of these seven are found in the Indian area.</p>

<p>A second form of {\female} occurs in which the ground-colour is pale primrose-yellow to pure white.</p>

<p>{\female.} In two forms. One resembles the {\male.} and the other has a white upperside (<b>albina</b> Evans).</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;A truncated cone, with longitudinal channels, and fine, transverse stri{\ae}. White at first, turning yellow later.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;5th instar. Bright grass-green, with a broad white dorsal line, generally showing the transverse lines of the segments as slight depressions throughout its length; sometimes a fine light, very thin spiracular line. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The snout conical, equilateral, its base being reckoned as the whole pupal diameter at the front margin of segment 2; the real snout is only the very extremity of this cone, and it is very short. Cremaster nearly square, gently concave at the end, depressed dorsally between slightly prominent subdorsal ridges, slightly depressed ventrally between the rounded marginal ridges, each slightly prominent extensor-ridge ending anteriorly in a little point or sharp tooth; the suspensory hooklets are arranged in a dense mass all along the posterior margin. Colour green, with the lateral outline along the wings yellow. Length, 16 mm.; breadth. 3.5 mm.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid on the upperside of a leaf, there being from 50 to 60 in a batch.The larv{\ae} are gregarious, eat voraciously, and grow very fast. Eggs obtained on 25th July emerged next day; larv{\ae} pupated on 2nd August; imago emerged on 6th August. The caterpillars feed in rows along the edge of a leaf, lying close pressed one against the other, and continue thus up to the last stage, when they become more independent though still keeping in batches. Each larva goes off to pupate separately The first meal is the egg-shell. Food-plants: <i>Salvadora persica</i> Linn. and <i>S. oleoides</i> Decne., 
<i>Azima tetracantha</i> Lam., all of the family Salvadorace{\ae}.</p>

<p>The butterfly has a fluttering flight, fairly straight and horizontal. it does not often frequent flowers, and keeps usually near the ground, being fond of open sunny places. The food-plant grows especially in waste desert places.</p>

<p>In a brood of about 50 there will always be a couple of white females, and this seems to be quite independent of climate. in damp areas the black markings on the upperside are larger and more intense.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular India</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Bengal;</span> not rare.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> salmon-pink. Fore wing with costa black, thickly overlaid with greyish or pinkish scales; a black discocellular spot, which may be large and quadrate or smaller and lunate; outer margin broadly black, bearing a double series of spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots consists of a large spot in area 1 <i>b</i>, two very small spots in 2 and 3, one in each, and four large anterior spots placed in a curve; the spots in the outer series are variable in number, usually one in each area, and more or less linear in shape. Hind wing with a band of dense black specialized scales (androconia) on the costal margin, extended to just within the upper edge of the cell; this band joins a broad, similarly coloured marginal band of ordinary scales that becomes more or less diffuse posteriorly, and encloses a double series of small spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots is often obsolescent or sometimes absent; inner area heavily dusted with fuscous, extending to the disc, which has therefore generally a greyish appearance.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> greenish-yellow; an anticiliary fine black line on both wings; the black markings of the upperside show through. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot, variable in size and sometimes absent; a submarginal quadrate black spot in area ! <i>b</i>, and another (sometimes faintly marked or absent) further outwards in area 2; disc faintly and inner margin very broadly salmon-pink. Hind wing sparsely dusted with black; a small black discocellular spot. Cilia of both wings pale salmon-pink. Antenn{\de}, head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} speckled with white, the head and thorax covered with greenish-fuscous hairs; underside of palpi green, of thorax and abdomen white.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to that of the {\male}, but the ground-colour very much paler and more ochraceous than green. Some specimens have on the fore wing an anterior post-discal curved fuscous band. Hind wing with discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}, and annular; a curved discal series of reddish spots from costa to inner margin.</p>
