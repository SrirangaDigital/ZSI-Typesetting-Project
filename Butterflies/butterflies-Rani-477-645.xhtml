<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>C. calais</i> (Cram.) [=<i>C. amata</i> (Fabr.)]. {\male} Fore wing with costa very slightly arched; apex obtuse, rounded, slightly convex; tornus abtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly or moderately convex or sinuate, abou<span class="smallcaps">Sikkim</span>t three-fourths the length of costa; cell about half length of wing wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, emitted moderately close together; 7+8 and 9 stalked at more than half-way from end of cell to apex; 6 from upper angle of cell or from near base of stalk of 7+8 and 9; <i>udc</i> absent, <i>mdc</i> usually at least half as long as <i>Idc.</i> Hind wing with costa arched; apex rounded; outer margin slightly arched; tornus obtuse but well marked; inner margin slightly convex; cell not half length of wing; precostal vein long, bent distad; vein 7 from the cell well distad; 5 and 6 either from the cell separately or connate or stalked; <i>Idc</i> oblique, concave, usually more than twice as long as <i>mdc.</i> Antenn{\ae} short, not half the length of the fore wing, club abrupt and spatulate head tufted anteriorly; palpus with third segment short, slender, acute at apex; eyes naked; body moderately robust.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p>The forms arranged under this genus, with the exception perhaps of those that belong to the genus <i>Eurema</i>, are, of all Pierid{\ae}, the most variable, seasonal and sexual dimorphism being very pronounced. As in <i>Ixias</i>, all transitions are found between the extreme wet-season and dry-season broods. The genus has its headquarters in Africa, where it is no less variable in India.</p>

<p>The species frequent hot and dry districts, and fly restlessly over the plains in the hot sunshine, or sail up and down rocky slopes. Many species are very abundant.</p>

<p><i>Distribution</i>.&#x2014;North Africa; Africa, south of the Sahara; Palestine and Arabia to Persia, <span class="smallcaps">North-West Inala, Penin-Sular India</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> Over 60 species are known in the genus, and of these seven are found in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\female.} In two forms. One resembles the {\male.} and the other has a white upperside (<b>albina</b> Evans).</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;A truncated cone, with longitudinal channels, and fine, transverse stri{\ae}. White at first, turning yellow later.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;5th instar. Bright grass-green, with a broad white dorsal line, generally showing the transverse lines of the segments as slight depressions throughout its length; sometimes a fine light, very thin spiracular line. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The snout conical, equilateral, its base being reckoned as the whole pupal diameter at the front margin of segment 2; the real snout is only the very extremity of this cone, and it is very short. Cremaster nearly square, gently concave at the end, depressed dorsally between slightly prominent subdorsal ridges, slightly depressed ventrally between the rounded marginal ridges, each slightly prominent extensor-ridge ending anteriorly in a little point or sharp tooth; the suspensory hooklets are arranged in a dense mass all along the posterior margin. Colour green, with the lateral outline along the wings yellow. Length, 16 mm.; breadth. 3.5 mm.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid on the upperside of a leaf, there being from 50 to 60 in a batch.The larv{\ae} are gregarious, eat voraciously, and grow very fast. Eggs obtained on 25th July emerged next day; larv{\ae} pupated on 2nd August; imago emerged on 6th August. The caterpillars feed in rows along the edge of a leaf, lying close pressed one against the other, and continue thus up to the last stage, when they become more independent though still keeping in batches. Each larva goes off to pupate separately The first meal is the egg-shell. Food-plants: <i>Salvadora persica</i> Linn. and <i>S. oleoides</i> Decne., 
<i>Azima tetracantha</i> Lam., all of the family Salvadorace{\ae}.</p>

<p>The butterfly has a fluttering flight, fairly straight and horizontal. it does not often frequent flowers, and keeps usually near the ground, being fond of open sunny places. The food-plant grows especially in waste desert places.</p>

<p>In a brood of about 50 there will always be a couple of white females, and this seems to be quite independent of climate. in damp areas the black markings on the upperside are larger and more intense.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular India</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Bengal;</span> not rare.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> salmon-pink. Fore wing with costa black, thickly overlaid with greyish or pinkish scales; a black discocellular spot, which may be large and quadrate or smaller and lunate; outer margin broadly black, bearing a double series of spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots consists of a large spot in area 1 <i>b</i>, two very small spots in 2 and 3, one in each, and four large anterior spots placed in a curve; the spots in the outer series are variable in number, usually one in each area, and more or less linear in shape. Hind wing with a band of dense black specialized scales (androconia) on the costal margin, extended to just within the upper edge of the cell; this band joins a broad, similarly coloured marginal band of ordinary scales that becomes more or less diffuse posteriorly, and encloses a double series of small spots of the ground-colour; the inner series of these spots is often obsolescent or sometimes absent; inner area heavily dusted with fuscous, extending to the disc, which has therefore generally a greyish appearance.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> greenish-yellow; an anticiliary fine black line on both wings; the black markings of the upperside show through. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot, variable in size and sometimes absent; a submarginal quadrate black spot in area ! <i>b</i>, and another (sometimes faintly marked or absent) further outwards in area 2; disc faintly and inner margin very broadly salmon-pink. Hind wing sparsely dusted with black; a small black discocellular spot. Cilia of both wings pale salmon-pink. Antenn{\de}, head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} head, thorax, and abdomen black, the antenn{\ae} speckled with white, the head and thorax covered with greenish-fuscous hairs; underside of palpi green, of thorax and abdomen white.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> similar to that of the {\male}, but the ground-colour very much paler and more ochraceous than green. Some specimens have on the fore wing an anterior post-discal curved fuscous band. Hind wing with discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}, and annular; a curved discal series of reddish spots from costa to inner margin.</p>

<p>There is a symmetrical gynandromorph from Karachi in the British Museum (ex coll. Oberth\dd{u}r). </p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly, generally near the base of the plant on old leaves. White at first, turning yellowish, with three broad reddish lateral bands. Long, dome-shaped, with 16 to 18 longitudinal ribs, the points of twelve forming a low crown round the micropyle.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Segments 2, 13, and 14 somewhat more narrowed than those of <i>amata;</i> segments 4 to 12 stout and cylindrical. Early instars grass-green with an indication of a spiracular light line. Anal flap rather large, dorsally somewhat flattened, and somewhat flanged round the edges. The yellow spots on the body are minute tubercles. Final instar identical with that of <i>protractus.</i></p>

<p>In the first instar, according to Fraser (1911), the head is shining jet-black; body grass-green with crimson stippling laterally, which on the posterior three segments spreads upwards and meets that of the opposite side so as to form a more or less prominent crimson patch</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Rather stout, the snout shorter than usual in this genus, and somewhat bluntly rounded at the tip. A dorsal and lateral constriction behind thorax. Cremaster with the subdorsal ridges more clearly defined than in <i>amata.</i> Colour pinkish-bone, with a dark dorsal line and some dark marks on the dorso-lateral legion of abdomen as well as at the apices of wing-veins. <b>Fraser</b> (1911) notes that the pupa is ``identical with that of <i>protractus</i>, usually flesh-coloured and without markings.''</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Sind</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Baluchistan</span> and <span class="smallcaps">United</span> <span class="smallcaps">Provinces</span>, extending to the Persian Gulf; not rare.

<p><b>colotis fausta</b> (Olivier). (Fig. 160)</p>

<p>{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> pale to deep salmon-buff. Fore wing with a black discocellular spot which is not connected with a dark costal border; a broad black distal border, narrowing posteriorly to a point at vein 2 or the tornus, and enclosing spots of the ground-colour; a series of small marginal spots. Hind wing with or without marginal black spots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with an oval patch of modified scales, placed in the proximal area above vein 1; this brand is more or less prominent on the upperside as a small raised spot.</p>

<p>{\female.} Dimorphic. one form resembling the {\male}, but without the sex-patch. Hind wing costal area on upperside not paler than the rest of the wing. The second form is white or partly white and partly salmon-buff.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Bottle-shaped, with 18 longitudinal ridges meeting in a thickened ring round the top. White at first, but soon turning yellowish, with three red irregular bands.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Rich green; sometimes a yellow narrow dorsal band, continued to the vertex; usually three large patches, light pinkish-brown with darker margins, in the spiracular region of segments 2, 8, and 11; sometimes there are eleven patches, which form a chain from segments 2 to 12. Lenght, 25 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;The longitudinal axis of the body is quite straight from the tip of the short, conical snout to the end of segment 13. The cremaster is as long as segment 13, and is trapeze-shaped, narrowing backwards, the hind margin or extremity being very distinctly concave. Usually livid bone-colour; a black dot laterally near the front margin of each segment, and sometimes a larger dorsal one near the hind margin of segments 8 and 9; the pupa is sometimes light green with the lateral line faintly yellow. Length, 19 mm.; breadth, 5 mm. at the broadest part.</p>

<p>This subspecies is distinguished by the fore wing upperside having the marginal black area extended to the tornus. {\female} whitr.</p>

<p>{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> ground-colour almost orange-yellow. Fore wing with costa heavily dusted with black; discocellular spot large, not annular; apical and marginal area black, enclosing not more than three moderately large subapical spots and a series of minute marginal specks of the ground-colour. Hind wing with the marginal black spots rather large.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> more richly yellow than in the nominotypical form; fore wing markings dusky black, those on hind wing rose-pink.</p>

<p><i>Upperside</i> white Fore wing with basal and costal areas heavily dusted with greyish-blue; marginal border broad, and with three subapical spots as in the {\male}. Hind wing with black marginal border and white marginal spots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing white, sometimes with faint yellow suffusion; apical and marginal areas anteriorly light to dark ochraceous-yellow; discocellular spot very large; a broad post-discal, macular, dark reddish-brown band. Hind wing pale ochraceous-yellow, sparsely powdered with black; post-discal macular reddish-brown band as broad as the fore wing.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 45-55 mm.</p>

<p>The dry-season form is <b>rosaceus</b> (Butl.), of which <i>palliseri</i> Butl. is a synonym.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are laid separately, generally on an old leaf, sometimes on a dry twig or leaf-scar. The food-plant is <i>M{\ae}rua arenaria</i> Hook. f. &amp; Thoms., family Capparidace{\ae}, a climbing shrub confined to places where the vegetation is comparatively scanty, and to more or less desert localities.</p>
 
<p>The males fly fast, generally near the ground. They frequent flowers among the grass, as also do the females, which are less commonly seen. A sun-loving butterfly, characteristic of the plains and desert regions.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> (northern part) and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">Inaia;</span> not rare. Between Bombay and Kanara <i>fulvia</i> overlaps the range of <i>faustina.</i></p>

<p><b>Colotis etrida</b> (Boisduval).</p>

<p>A Indian species occurring in two races. To be recognized by its white ground-colour, the fore wing bearing an apical orange patch which is edged with black on the inner side.</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014;Longer than broad, the apical third conical; eight longitudinal ridges, which are transversely striate. Surface shiny, at first yellowish and changing to reddish, caused by profuse blotching.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Resembles that of <i>Eurema hecabe</i> (Linn.), but the anal segment ends in two short and obscure knobs. A broad white spiracular band touched with orange above each spiracle, and bordered below by a slightly less broad pur-chocolate band; venter green. Length 19 mm.; breadth, 3 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Also of the type of <i>Eurema hecabe</i> (Linn.). Snout slightly upturned, and cremastral extremity distinctly bifid. Ground-colour pinkish-bone; a prominent green-sepia band above the spiracular line from segments 6 and 7 to 13; a similarly coloured dorsal band from the head to the same segment; abdomen streaked with three similar light-coloured lateral bands. When the pupa is more strongly developed. Length, 18 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

 <p><i>Underside</i> with apex of fore wing and whole surface of hind wing suffused lightly, or in specimens from very dry localities heavily, with ochraceous. Fore wing with spots in areas 1 <i>b</i> and 3 as on upperside. Hind wing with a discal, curved, almost complete series of fuscous spots; otherwise, as in the {\male.} In both sexes the antenn{\ae} vary from white to pale brownish; head thorax, and abdomen black, head and thorax with short greyish-brown hairs; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.</p>
 
 <p>The name <b>casimirus</b> (Butl.) (=<i>bimbura</i> Butl.) refers to specimens from dry localities, in which the orange patch is paler and the black markings obsolescent. On the <i>underside</i> the hind wing and apical area of fore wing are more or less ochraceous.</p>
 
 <p><i>Habits</i> (From <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&amp;The eggs are laid singly. Pupation nearly always on the underside of a leaf near the ground, so that the chrysalis is exposed to the soil or a dead leaf or other light object, and this probably accounts for the majority of those found being bone-coloured instead of green. The larva feeds upon capers, and has been bred most commonly upon <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam.</p>

<p><i>Tercolus eucharis</i> f. <i>pallens,</i> Fruhstorfer, 1910, p. 174.</p>

<p>This is very probably conspecific with two African forms.</p>

<p>{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> pure white. Fore wing with base and costa for a short distance generally sparsely dusted with black; a broad apical orange-yellow patch, with its inner edge straight and margined with gamboge-yellow; this patch is sometimes immaculate, but generally bears a black diffuse spot on its lower inner edge which may or may not extend to the outer margin below the orange; costa and outer margin bordered with black, which is much reduced in specimens from dry areas. Hind wing with marginal black costal spot.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> usually pure white, suffused except on disc of fore wing, with pinkish-yellow, and at base of same wing with pure sulphur-yellow; the orange patch and marginal black show through from the upperside, the former crossed by a sinuous fuscous band that ends in a black diffuse spot. Hind wing shaded with ochraceous at the base, and with a subapical fuscous costal spot, also a few scattered transverse fuscous stri{\ae} and small spots. Many specimens have the subapical spot continued as an obscure fuscous band across the wing, and bear a series of large marginal fuscous spots. Both wings with black discocellular dots. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen black; antenn{\ae} speckled with white on the  sides, bead and thorax clothed with short greyish-brown hairs; underside of palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> of fore wing with base and costa more heavily dusted with black; discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}; apical area black, with three enclosed elongate orange spots; inner edge of black area irregularly sinuate and diffuse, extended shortly inwards in area 3; a transverse black spot across the middle of area 1 <i>b.</i> Hind wing with sparse greyish-black basal dusting; subpical spot and marginal spots much larger than in the {\male;} sometimes there is an obscure transverse posterior discal band.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with markings much broader and more prominent than in the {\male;} the fuscous stri{\ae} and dots more numerous.</p>

<p>The dry-season form <b>aurora</b> (Cram.) (=<i>pallens</i> Moore) has reduced black markings, and the hind wing underside is rose-red.</p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 40-45 mm.</p>

<p>In the British Museum are 2 {\male}{\male}, probably of the dry season, in which the orange apical area is absent. They are creamy white instead of chalky-white; hind wing underside immaculate. (Bombay, 1887, January and November) (ex Coll. Swinhoe).</p>

<p><i>Early stages and habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.&#x2014;Shape almost like a bell-jar, with 17 longitudinal ribs, some of which form a crown of teeth round the top; each rib is cross-rayed many times, producing a beaded appearance. Orange, with subcutaneous dull blotches.</i></p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>The tubercles of the body are comparatively large and conspicuous as compared with <i>C. dana.</i> Dark green to yellowish-green, with a light dorsal band generally present, body obscurely darker spotted; in some individuals there is a large, more or less triangular pinkish-brown white patch, including the spiracles of segments 6 to 8, the anterior one generally the smallest, increasing backwards, the largest never reaching the line of the dorso-lateral tubercles, and never extended posteriorly to farther than the centre of the segment. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Shape more like that of <i>Valeria</i> than other <i>Colotis</i> species. Snout conical and very rugose. Glaucous-green with a yellow shade, the whole surface vermiculate with little short, whitish lines; a yellow-white lateral wing-line from the shoulders, continued along abdomen to cremaster. The colour may be darker green or light yellowish-brown, marbled and blotched with white and darker brown. Length, 17 mm.; breadth, 4 mm.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly often on a dead thorn or twig. The larv{\ae} turn pink before pupation, and are much subject to the attacks of parasites, over 50 per cent. dying from this cause. The food-plant is usually <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam., a shrub common in waste places and hedges in the Deccan. The butterfly emerges in about a week.</p>

<p>The butterfly emerges in about a week.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a weak flier, keeping near the ground, and generally found in numbers near the food-plant to the flowers of which it is attracted. The male rests frequently on the ground, and likes the sun. The female is not often seen.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> to <span class="smallcaps">Central</span> <span class="smallcaps">India;</span> common.</p>

<p><b>Colotis dan{\ae}</b> (Fabricius).</p>

<p>This species resembles <i>etrida</i> (Boisd.), from which it can be distinguished by the apical patch of the fore wing being crimson, and in the {\female} this patch is traversed by a dark macular band.</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Resembles in appearance a small <i>Hebomoia.</i> Usually glaucous-green, with many indistinct whitish spots or short lines; a broad spiracular white line, which may be bordered above by plum-colour or brown-orange. Length, 20 mm.; breadth, 3.5 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.</i>&#x2014;Stout, with a short, thickly conical head process, a prominent ventral wing-bulge, and thorax moderately humped. Green or bone-colour, with slight marblings and transverse lines, which in the green form may be absent.</p>

<p>Length, 15-16 mm.; breadth, 4.5 mm. at the shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">Sind</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Baluchistan</span> and Persia; extending to Africa south of the Sahara. Two subspecies in the Indian area</p>

<p>This subspecies is very variable, especically in the {female.}</p>

<p>{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> white, the base of wings dusted with black. to a variable extent, and sometimes not at all. Fore wing with or without a minute discocellular black spot; apical area broadly carmine, edged proximally and distally with black, both edges meeting on the costa and outer margin, and sometimes extending as a black line to the tornus. Hind wing with marginal black spots, varying in size and sometimes reduced to more or less obsolescent, unconnected dots.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> white. Fore wiing with base of cell washed with sulphur-yellow; discicellular spot as on upperside; an ochraceous-pink apical patch, not margined with black, but similar in shape and position to the patch on the upperside, and sometimes more or less suffused with greyish; this patch is crossed near its inner edge by an obliquely placed series of four or five spots that vary in colour from pale ferruginous to black, in some specimens there are two marginal diffuse black spots, one each at the ends of veins 2 and 3. Hind wing sometimes pure white, but usually suffused with ochraceous-pink to a greater or less extent; a small discocellular spot, pale ferruginous to black, sometimes annular and centred with carmine; a discal, curved, macular band, varying from pale ferruginous to black, the posterior spots often obsolescent or entirely absent; a series of marginal black vein-dots which are sometimes connected by a fine marginal line. Antenn{\ae} pale brown, speckled with white; head, thorax, and abdomen black; head and thorax anteriorly clothed with brown, sometimes greyish-black hairs; underside of palpi thorax, and abdomen white.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> white, the base of wings more or less heavily dusted with greyish-black, sometimes extended as a broad band parallel to the inner margin of the hind wing. Fore wing with carmine patch smaller than in the {\male}, sometimes reduced to a row of pale, rosy, subapical streaks, but always bordered distally, and generally proximally also, by black of varying width; sometimes the inner black border is very narrow, in others broad, and in a very few entirely absent; discocellular spot larger than in the {\male}, a post-discal, anterior, macular, curved black band, the upper spots of which cross the carmine area, or where this is reduced it crosses the black proximal edging; a black, transverse, somewhat diffuse spot in area 1 <i>b</i> and 2. Hind wing with a dusky discocellular spot; a discal, black, macular, curved band, more or less incomplete; marginal black spots, sometimes connected to form a continuous band. All these markings are generally diffuse.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing white, suffused with sulphur-yellow at base of cell and with an ochraceous, sometimes with a greyish or reddish, tinge over the apical area; discocellular spot, post-discal band, and spots in areas 1<i>b</i> and 2 as on upperside but more clearly defined, the spots that compose white, suffused to a greater or less degree with ochraceous, sometimes pink; discocellular spot and discal band as on upperside, but more clearly defined, annular, and generally centred with carmine; marginal black specks which may or may not be connected by a fine marginal line.</p>

<p><i><i>Expanse:</i> {\male}{\female}, 40-50 mm.</i></p>

<p>The name <b>taplini</b> (Swinhoe) refers to an extreme dry-season form with much reduced black marking, and the <i>underside</i> with apical area of fore wing and entire hind wing reddish-ochraceous. An intermediate form is <i>sanguinalis</i> (Butler), and this name should be applied to the dry-season form as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on an old leaf or its stalk. Larva turns pink before pupating. it is much subject to the attacks of parasites, and the pupa is attacked by flies. The pupal stage lasts about a week.  The food-plants are capers, and the butterfly has been bred on <i>Cadaba indica</i> Lam., <i>Capparis sepiaria</i> Linn., and <i>C. divaricata</i> Lam., also on <i>M\{ae}rua arenaria</i> Hook. f. &amp; Thoms.</p>

<p>With the exception of the male of <i>C. fausta</i> (Oilv.) the butterfly flies straighter than other Indian species of the genus. It keeps to the ground, and is never found in the jungles and regions of heavy rainfall. Both sexes are found in about equal numbers.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&#x2014;<span class="smallcaps">Ceylon</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Peninsular</span> <span class="smallcaps">India;</span> not rare. According to Evans (1910) the butterfly is common in the Palni Hills from April to June and August to October.</p>

<p><i>I phias</i>, Boisduval, 1836, p. 595.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>H. glaucippe</i> (Linn.).</p>

<p>{\male}{\female.} Fore wing triangular; costa arched; apex more or less acute; outer margin oblique, slightly sinuate; tornus well marked, obtuse; inner margin bisinuate; cell slightly more than half lenght of wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell, close together, running almost parallel for most of their length; 7+8 and 9 on a long stalk; 6 from the cell, forming a short <i>udc; mdc</i> about half the length of <i>idc</i>, which is angled. Hind wing suboval, broad; apex and tornal angle boldly rounded; precostal vein long, bent sharply distad. Antenn{\ae} not more than half the length of fore wing, club gradual; eyes naked, prominent; palpi somewhat flattened, scaly, clothed with stiff hairs anteriorly and at the apex, third segment short and oval; thorax and abdomen robust; legs slender.</p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Genitalia</i> (from <i>Klots</i>, 1931).&#x2014;Penis without a basal prong; saccus slender, about as long as tegumen; uncus short, curved, bifurcate; a well chitinized area immediately beneath base of uncus and above anus; juxta well developed, hollowed out; valve with a dorsal and a distal process; harpe of medium size, with a dorsal point.</p>

<p>The <i>Hebomoia</i> are the largest Pierids found in the Oriental Region. The males usually fly in the morning, frequenting the edges of paths and woods and open thickets, coming also to <i>Lantana</i> flowers; during the hotter hours they settle on moist sand. The females are sluggish and remain in the thickets.</p>

<p>The species of this genus like those of <i>Ixias</i> and <i>Colotis</i>, Possess a brightly coloured apical area on the fore wing upperside, whilst the underside of hind wing and apical area of fore wing possess a cryptic coloration. In <i>Hebomoia</i> these characters are more strongly developed than in the two other genera. When at rest the underside blends well with the surroundings, as the proximal area of the fore wing is covered by the hind wing, the margin of which adjoins the apical area of the fore wing.</p>

<p><b>Hebomoia glaucippe</b> (Linn{\ae}us)</p>

<p>{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> white or yellow, the latter colour only found on the hind wing in one Indian race. Fore wing with apical half black, bearing a large orange patch which usually enters the end of the cell; the extension of the black area proximally of the orange patch is variable, and is often absent in specimens from dry areas. Hind wing with a few anterior marginal black spots or sometimes a very narrow marginal black border.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> of fore wing with proximal area white; apical area mottled brown or reddish. Hind wing similar to apical area of fore wing; a prominent deep brown or blackish line from base to outer margin, passing through middle of cell.</p>

<p>{\female.} Similar to the {\male.} <i>upperside</i> of fore wing with smaller orange patch, the black spots on its distal part enlarged and often cutting off a series of submarginal orange spots; proximal area often yellowish, with black basal dusting.

<p><i>Egg</i> (fig. 164).&#x2014;Elongate, three times as long as broad; 11 or 12 longitudinal ribs, of which each alternate one forms a sharp tooth at the top of the egg. At first shining white with a pink shade, turning yellow later.</p>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&#x2014;Body with the dorsal half-segments convex, the ventral ones flattened; anal segment projecting over the anal claspers, narrowed, truncate, with a slight indentation in the centre of extreme margin. Body glaucous-green, lighter in the spiracular region, with a beaded, white, subspiracular line from segment 13 to the head; the lower half of the beads on this line is orange except on segment 3, where it is blue; through each one of the transverse tubercles (eachrow of such reaching to the spiracular line on each side) runs a short, longitudinal, purple line. Length, 47 mm., breadth, at segment 3, nearly 8 mm.</p>

<p><i>Pupa.&#x2014;The shape is that of <i>Catopsilia.</i> Head process conical at base, cylindrical anteriorly, slightly up-turned at tip, and very rugose. Cremaster narrow-triangular, bifid at end, extensor ridges rugose, strong and ventral. Ground-clour dark yellowish-green; dorsum and a lateral headband purple; a large dorsal spot on segments 4, 5, and 9. Length, 37.5 mm.; breadth, 9.4 mm. at the shoulders.</i></p>

<p>figure</p>

<p><i>Habits</i>&#x2014;The eggs are laid singly on the upperside of a leaf, usually on an old one close to the ground. The newly-hatched larva eats the egg-shell. The larva pupates on the underside of a leaf well hidden near the ground or close to the stem. The food-plants are Capparidace{\ae}, the larva being commonly found on <i>Crat{\ae}va religiosa</i> Forst. f., also often upon the large climber <i>Capparis moonii</i> wight.</p>

<p>The butterfly has a very strong and powerful  flight. it is fond of the sun, often rests on the ground, goes to damp places, and comes freely to flowers. When at rest on the ground among leaves or rubbish the insect is quite invisible, the colour and pattern blending so well with the surroundings.</p>

<p><i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>V valeria</i> (Cram.).</p>

<p><i>{\male}{\female}</i>. Fore wing with costa strongly arched; apex blunt; outer margin slightly sinuate, concave in the middle; tornus rounded; inner margin straight, about three-fourths length of costa; cell about half length of wing; veins 10 and 11 from the cell; 7, 8, 9 stalked; 6 from upper angle of cell; <i>mdc</i> more than half as long as <i>ldc.</i> Hind wing subtriangular; cell long, over half length of wing; discocellulars subequal and very oblique; precostal vein long, turned slightly distad. Antenn{\ae} much longer than half length of fore wing, club gradual, long and slender, palpi very short, third segment short, almost truncate at apex; eyes large, naked; thorax and abdomen particularly of <i>V avatar</i> (Moore), have a band of androconia over the apical and marginal black border of the hind wing upperside.</p>

<p>This genus is closely allied ti <i>Eronia</i> Butler, the species of which are found throughout Africa. The two genera are apparently connected by <i>V avatar</i> (Moore), which by pattern and genitalia approximates to <i>Eronia.</i></p>

<p>The males are bluish-white to bluish-green, with the veins blackened on both sides, more so on the upperside, where there is a tendency to the formation of a striped pattern. A distinctly striped pattern is found in the females, which are black, with stripes and spots of green, white, brownish or yellow. They resemble Danaines very strongly, not only in pattern but also in flight. The female may be monomorphic, dimorphic, or trimorphic, the pattern in each case resembling particular Danaines found in the same locality.</p>

<p>Resemble <i>V hippia</i> (Fabr.) in colour and disposition of the markings, but differs as follows:&#x2014;{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> ground-colour of a deeper blur. Fore wing with outer black border much broader generally, without submarginal spots, or only one or two present. Hind wing with outer black border very broad, narrowing slightly to the tornus.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> as in <i>hippia.</i></p>

<p>{\female.} Closely resembles the {\female} of <i>V hippia</i>, but on the <i>upperside</i> the outer black margins beyond the discal markings on both wings are proportionately much broader, the submarginal spots placed further from the margin.</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> with marginal black borders broader and darker, the submarginal spots on apex of fore wing and on hind wing absent or very indistinct and blurred. Antenn{\ae}, head, thorax, and abdomen in both sexes much as in <i>V hippia.</i></p>

<p><i>Expanse:</i>{\male}{\female}, 65-80 mm.</p>

<p><i>Dry-season form</i> <b>fraterna</b> (Moore).&#x2014;{\male.} <i>Upperside</i> with narrower black borders and less heavy vein-streaks.</p> 

<p><i>Underside</i> with the outer borders scarcely less darkened than the rest of the wing, and black markings on fore wing much smaller.</p>

<p>{\female} <i>Upperside</i> markings broader and more bluish. <i>Underside</i> of fore wing with apical area bluish; hind wing bluish, the outer border darker, and submarginal spots prominent.</p>

<p>The name <b>pingasa</b> (Moore) may be used to denote a large form of the extreme wet-season type in which the black ground-colour is greatly extended.</p>

<p><i>Habits</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914).&#x2014;The eggs are deposited usually in evergreen jungle at above 100 feet. They are laid singly, and often very close to the ground. Pupa attached to the underside of a leaf or thin twig. The food-plant is <i>Capparis heyneana</i> Wall.</p>

<p>The butterfly is a strong flier, but keeps to the shade of the underwood. The female may be found more often at rest than the male; it does not usually frequent flowers, and is never found at water. The female is never found flying in the same way as the male and is generally seen fluttering around in the underwood, looking like a <i>Danaus aglea</i> (Cram.).</p>

<p><b>Valeria valeria</b> (Cramer, 1776).</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. A. S. Corbet for some enlightenment on this species, which he is investigating. <i>V valeria</i> can be divided into two groups, which may be termed the <i>Hippia</i> and <i>Valeria</i> groups. These groups are especially distinguished by the form of the genital armature. The valve is furnished with a small ventral process which is apparently the harpe. In the <i>Hippia</i> group this process is well rounded and broad ventrally, and projects beyond the edge of the valve. The {\ae}deagus is strongly curved posteriorly. In the <i>valeria</i> group the harpe is long and narrow, does not project ventrally, and is directed dorsad, lying entirely within the valve. The {ae}deagus is straight or only slightly curved, and is anteriorly broader than in the <i>hippia</i> forms. Only the <i>Hippia</i> group is known to occur in the Indian area.</p>

<p>{\male} <i>Upperside</i> bluish-white, paler than in <i>ceylanica</i> (Feld.).</p>

<p><i>Underside</i> also whiter; all the veins strongly defined by black. Fore wing with submarginal spots which are also well marked on the underside of both wings.</p>

<p>{\female} Dimorphic in the Indian subspecies, and trimorphic in some other areas. The principal form resembles <i>ceylanica</i> (Feld.), but is whiter, with more prominent submarginal spots. The second and rarer form has the hind wing upperside with yellow discal area</p>

<p><i>Early stages</i> (from <i>Bell</i>, 1914):&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Egg.</i>&#x2014; A pointed oval, the apex crowned with a circle of 7 or 8 small, pointed teeth; 17 longitudinal, minutely beaded</p>
