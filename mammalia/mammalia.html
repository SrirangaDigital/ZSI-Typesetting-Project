<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>BLANFORD'S volume on the Mammals of British India, published in two parts in 1888 and 1891, fulfilled satifisfactorily the purpose for which it was compiled, and was for many years the standard work on the  subject. The material at his disposal*, however, was enterely insuffcient according to modern standards, and the book has admittedly been long out of date. Various factors, such as general increase in our knowledge of Indian mammals and the use of  other characters than end ; but perhaps the greatest was the new impetus given towards the end of the last century to the study of systematic mammalogy the  world over by  Hart Merriam's introduction of his scheme for investigating the mammalian fauna of the United States by means of intentsive colleting and accourate  labelling, with  measurements, dates, and altitudes, of long series of specimens,  where availble, of every species from carefully selected  localites. This threw a flood of light upon  the variations of individuals of a species from the same locality and environment with age and season  or  irrespective of those factors, and also upon the adaptive modifications a species  may locally exhibit when disributed over a wide  geographical area with diversified physical features.</p>

<p>* It is needless to repeat the sources whence he derived his information, since they are fully acknowledged in his introdution. Incidentally however, he  candidly admitted that, on account of the numerous inaccuaries they contained, he  referred as little as possible to the work of J.E.Gray, who described a very large number of alleged Indian species.This  was a pity, because the inaccuracies called for correction, and Gray, in spite of his errors, showed now and
again unexpected perspicacity in his determinations, with the result that Blanford, in dismissing his opinions, was not infrequently wrong. In those days, too, authors assumed greater latitude in adopting names they preferred, and were less strictly adherent to the law of priority.</p>
              
<p>To the older  school systematic mammalogists, who adopted the Linnaean  binominal method of indicating a supposed  species by  its generic  and  specific names,such modifications were more or less vaguely known, and were given full specific status if held to be imporant enough to warrant that rank, or were cited as ``varieties'' if falling short of that standard. But with the new method of studying mammals the term  ``variety'' was restricted to such individual aberrations from the normal as are illustated by melanism or albinism, for example, and the term ``subspeies'' was invented to symbolize the geographical and  environmental variants of a species.At the same time the trinominal system of nomenclature, now in vogue, was introduced to designate the " subspecies," or " local races "  as they are often called, into which  most widly distributed species can be divided.</p> 
 
<p>This system is particularly useful in supplying additional machinery for achieving the main purpose of nomenclature, namely, the expression of the degree  of kinship between related animals. This may be illustrated  by a very simple instance taken from Blanford as disinct species, the hill-fox, the desert-fox, and the three are equally different from each other, and enterely conceals the close affinity  between the hill-fox and the desert-fox  and the more remote kinship  between them and the Bengal fox. The facts are now expressed by regarding the first two as subspecies of the so-called common fox and by citing them as <i>Vulpes vulpes momtana and Vulpes vulpes pusilla</i> respectivly, and the Bengal fox as <i>Vulpes bengalensis.</i></p> 
 
<p>In theory this sustem appears simple,but it is by no means always so in practice. Where a complete series of examples of a species spread over a wide diversified area is available, it is the custom to select for subspecific denomination the best differentiated local races, leaving the equally interesting intermediate forms without the trinominal symbol. But the number of names introduced will depend upon the judgment of the systematist; and in this respect there is often great diversity of opinion. Actual proof, moreover, of the intergradation of different forms  is by no means always availble. in this case decision as to the specific or subspecies status of a distinguishable  form is also a matter for the judgment of the individual systematist, and considerable discrepancy of view  on his point may arise. At present there is no unanimity ; and serveral of the forms I have treated as subspecires in this volume may be regarded by others as species or held to be unnecssarily named*</p>

<p>Mr. Oldfield Thomas, then in charge of the collection of Mammals in the British Museum, was at once impressed by the interesting results achieved in North America by Merriam and his staff of collectors and students. He conceived the idea  of extending the same scheme to all possible countries of the Old World and lost no time in putting it in practice. When Mr. R.C. Wroughton, I.F.S., on retiring from office and coming to England, offered his services as voluntary  assistant to Mr. Thomas, they speedily discovered the poverty of the National Collection in Oriental mammals, and decided, if possible, to inaugurate a collecting campaign in British India with the ultimate object of issuing a new edition of Blanford volume. The first and, as it proved, the wisest step was to get in touch with  Mr. W.S. Millard, the Honorary Secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society. With characteristic energy and enthusiasm Mr. Millard at once took the matter in hand and, with the sanction of the Committee of the Society, proceeded to collect funds to defray the cost of sending collectors to various districts of the Indian Empire and also to interest sportsmen, forest officers, and other members of the Society in the enterprise. Thus was started, at first in a small way, in 1911 the Mammal Survey of India, Ceylon, and Burma, which,owing to the generosity of numerous subscribers and the diligence of the employed and voluntary collectors, yielded in the following years results which far exceeded expectations. The outbreak and duration of the world war temporarily suspended the activities of the Survey ; but they were later resumed, and after April 1920, when Mr. Millard retired and came to England, they were carried on by Mr. R.A. (now Sir Reginald) Spence, who succeeded him as Hon Secretary to the Society.</p>

<p>* The modern method has,however,been by no means an unmixed benefit. It attracted into systematic mammalogy on both sides of the Atlantic  amateurs to  whom the determination of species was child's play, comparable to the matching of samples of silk or wool, and whose sole  qualification  for the work was ability to detect differences in the  colour or pattern of skins and the shapes of skulls,without the training and judgment required to assess their value. It engendered the idea that is a difference of locality was sure to be accompanied by a difference in colour, coat or some other part, and that if such could be preceived it was worth symbolizing by a new name, no regard being paid to the great possibility of age or season being the cause, thus  bringing the dissinguishing feature within the range of individual vaiation. The late Mr. R.C. Wroughton once humorously expressed this conception to me by saying that two hundred miles was a good specific character ! The net result of this influx of inexperienced workers on the new liones has been the addition of large numbers of  names which, although without real significance, have to be reckoned with and investigated by the serious student, thus leading to waste of time and making his task difficult enough already, still more exacting and arduous.</p>

<p>Donations to the fund were duly acknowledged, as received, in the Society's 'Journal' ; but since the present volume on the Mammals of British India, and those that are to follow, are based to a very great extent upon the results of the Survey, it is fitting that the names of the individuals,Governments, Societes, and other bodies that contributed to its success should be put permanently on record.</p>

<p>The princials subscribers were as follows:- The Governments of India, Ceylon, and Burma, of Bihar and Orissa, Bombay,the Central Provinces the United Provinces, Madaras, the Federated MalayStates,and Junagadh State; the Trustees of the British Museum, The Royal and Zoological Societies of London, and the Trustees of the late N. M. Wadia, C.I.E.; H.H.the Maharaja of Bhavanagar, the Maharaja of Bikanir, the Rao of Cutch, the Raja of Dhar, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja Tukojirao Holkar of Indore, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, the Maharao of Kotah, the Maharaja of Mysore, and the Maharaja Sir Madhowrao Scindia of Gwalior ; the  Most Hon. the Marquis of Bute, Sir Dorab J Tata, the Hon. N.C.Rothschild, the Hon. E.S. Montagu, M.P., Sir Ratan J. Tata, and Messrs. E.Comber, W. S. Millard, H.M.Phipson, and Oldfield Thomas. Finally, the last of the expeditions, sent out by the Society in 1929 to the Eastern Ghats, where large numbers of birds as well as mammals were secured, was generously financed by Mr.A.S. Vernay.</p>

<p>Of the collectors, the first to be employed by the Society for the Mammal Survey  was Mr.C.A. Crump, and when sufficient money had been received, Mr. Oldfiled Thomas sent out to India Mr.G.C.Shortridge and, later on, Major A.W Mayor. In addition to these collectors, Messrs. S.H. Prater, C.MeCann, and N.A.Baptista-who were employees on the staff of the Society-also assisted in collecting for the survey. In 1914-owing to the War-Major Mayor, Mr.Shortridge, and Mr.Crump``joined uo'' in France, but Messrs. C. Primrose, Ryley O'Brien, and H.W Wells were still able to give their assistance ; and when in Burma Mr.Shortridge availed himself of the services of the late  Capt. Macmillan. But the work of the collectors was greatly helped by influential residents in various districts, by H.H. the Maharao Sahib in Kutch, H.H.the Maharaja Sir Madhowrao Scindia in Gwalior, Messrs. H.Stevens and R.S.Lister in Darjeeling, the late A.P. Kinloch in Mahabar, A.H.A. Simcox in Khandesh, and in Burma by the late Sir Harvey Adamson, the Governor, and Sir Godfrey Fell.</p>

<p>Many valuable and interesting specimens were also contributed to the Survey by voluntary collectors. Of these the principal were Col. A.E. Ward in Kashmir, Col. C.H. Stockley in the Punjab and western Himalayas, Mr J P. Mills in Assam, Col. J.E.B.(now Sir Ernest) Hotson in Baluchistan, Mr.W W A. Phillips in Ceylon, and by Mr.J M. D. Mackenzie, Mr. Kingdon Ward, and Lord Cranbrook in Burma. Of special moment were the extensive collections made by  Mr. J. M.D.Mackenzie and Sir Ernest Hotson.</p>

<p>The importance of the survey material was due not only to the large numbers of specimens secured, but also to the accurate information supplied regarding the dates, localities, altitudes, sex, and measurements of most of the skins. The collections from each district were packed in Bombay and sent to the British Museum of Natural History to be identified by the official staff and the voluntary helpers, Mr.R.C.Wroughton. Mr. T.B.Fry, Miss Ryley, and Mrs. Lindsay. It was arranged that the British Museum should keep the ``types'' of new forms discoverd*, as well as a reasonable number of other specimens required, the remainder to be returned to Bombay to be dealt with as the Natural History Society thought fit. The carrying out of the scheme involved a vest amount of work at both ends, and in this respect the services of Mr. R.C Wroughton in London and of Mr. N.B. Kinnear in Bombay cannot be overestimated. The reports were published <i>seriation</i> in the ` Journal' of the Bombay Society, with the scientfic names and localities of the species and such notes regarding habits and the vernacular names as were supplied by the collectors.</p>

<p>It was tge intention of Mr. Hinton and Mr.Wroughton finally to collate the ressults as a basis for a new edition of Blanford's volume,. When Mr. Wroughton's untimely death brought this scheme to a close, Mr. Hinton invited me, on my retirement from the zoological Society in 1923, to collaborate with him in the work, each of us doing such groups as we had previously particularly studied. This I undertook, little realizing the length of time that would be required owing to the vast amount of material to be handled, the number of skulls to be measured, the extent to which the names and characters of the described genera, species, and subspecies called for revision, and the necessity for studying the mammals of all the adjoining districts of Asia before those of British India could be adequately dealt with.</p>

<p>One of the first things that came to light was the general poverty of the British Museum collection in representatives. of such familiar Indian animals as lions, tigers, panthers, snow-leopards, bears, wolves, and, as has been subsequently proved, of nearly all the species usually understood by the pharse ``big game''*. These deficiencies had to be made good, as far as was possible, for the first two volumes of the Mammalian Fauna. Appeals published in the `Journal of the Bombay  Natural History Society,' begging-letters to many of its members, and requests to personal friends for specimens met with immediate response, and I am especially appreciative of the generosity of the those who sent to me for the work in hand  valuable and handsome skins, as well as skulls, of the larger Carnivora, of which the British Museum was particularly in need. A point has been made of citing the names of the donors where the specimens are referred to in the text ; but in addition  I take this opportunity of recording my indebtedness to be  following  sportsmen not only for the animals from India, Ceylon, Burma, and adjoining countries, but also in many cases for information regarding their habits and occurrence :-</p>

 <p>* It was agreed that the types should be kept in London because the climate condition in Bombay are not so favourable for their preservation. Several factors contributed to this end. For many years there was a widespread opinion that such beasts were of comparatively little zoological interest and were not wanted by the National Collection. Sportsmen also are very naturally loth to part with handsome skins and heads, preferring to preserve them as trophies and cherished mementoes of the chase. Finally the Survey collectors were requested to concentrate upon the smaller members of the mammalian fauna and to leave big game unmolested so as to avoid trespassing upon what might be considered to be sportsmen's privilege. This decision, if wise, was regrettable because tigers and panthers show environmental adaptions as well as rats and mice, and because, with the progressive reclaiming of the country from the wild and bringing it under cultivation, the larger species will be the first to disappear, and well-preserved representatives fate overtakes them. As an instance may be cited the now irretrievable loss to the British Museum of examples of the two finest races of lions, from the cape and Algeria respectively, owing to the authorities in the past being uninterested in these animals and not foreseeing their inevitable extinction.</p>

<p>I am also indebted to Mr. N.B.Kinnear for advice and suggestions on various point, and very particularly to Mr. W.S.Millard, a personal friend of many years, who has consistently and sympathetically helped me in too many ways to mention in detail*.</p>

<p>For permission to use many blocks for illustrations I am indebted to the Bombay Natural History Society, and for the Joan of ``types'' or other interesting specimens I am under great obligations to the Hon. Secretaries and other officials of the Bombay Natural History Society, to Col. Seymour Sewell, C.I.E.,F.R.S., and Dr. Baini prashad, who succeeded him as Director of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and to be Field Museum, Chicago.</p>

<p>For the purely zoological part of this volume, with its avoidable and unavoidable mistakes, I take full responsibility. The vernacular names of the species have been accepted on trust ; and since my personal knowledge of the habits of the animals is limited to abservations on captive specimens in the Zoological  Gardens of London, I have been compelled to borrow the information on this head from the writings of others. But the literature on this subject in the way of books and stray notes in periodicals is now so extensive that it has been impossible to become acquainted with it all or to acknowledge in every case the authority for statements made. It will, I trust, be understood that the omission to quote the observations of many sportsmen was due, not to inappreciation of their value, but to the bar to their inclusion imposed by the limit of time and the size of the volume.</p>

<p>This volume includes the Apes, Monkeys, and Lemurs of the order Primates and the first two families, the Cats and Civets, of the order Carnivora. It is hoped that the second volume, containing the remaining families of the Carnivora, and some at all events of the groups of Hoofed Mammals, will be issued in about a year's time.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                                    
<p><b>THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAMMALS OF BRITISH INDIA</b></p>

<p>FROM thew zoological standpoint the greater part of British India is a portion of the so-called Oriental Region, one of the primary subdivisions into which the land-surface of the world has been divided, mainly on the evidence of the average distinctiveness of their mammalian and avine faunas. In south-eastern Asia the usually accepted boundary of this region is ``Wallace's line,'' passing between the islands of Bali and Lombok to the east of Jeva, and continued northward between Borneo and Celebes, a line marked by deep sea indicating a long-continued marine barrier which prevented most of the highly organized Oriental mammals, like the apes, leaf-monkeys,cats,mongooses, members of the dog and weasel families, bears, banteng cattle, rhinoceroses, and many others which were later comers to that part of Asia, from reaching Celebes and other islands to the east of the line, and similarly prevented the lowly organized marsupial mammals, characteristic of the Australian Region, from entering Borneo and Java. But some of the typically Oriental mammals, like macaque monkeys, plam-civets,deer, buffalo, pigs, and pangolins, were suffciently early migrants from the west to get a footing in Celebes or other islands to the east of what is now Wallace's line, so that there is here a blend of the faunas of the two regions.</p>

<p>Still less satisfactory are the boundaries of the Oriental Region  to the north, where, owing to its complete land-continuity with south-western, central, and northern Asia, which, with Europe and North Africa and most of North America, constitutes the Holarctic Region, the faunas of the two so intimately intergrade that the line defining them can only be arbitrarily drawn roughly from Central China along the Himalayas and thence southwards through the deserts of north-western India to the Arabian Sea.</p>

<p>In thew extreme varety of its physical features India proper, or Hindustan,is surpassed by no country of similar extent in the world. It is divided into three main areas, the HImalayas in the north, the great Indo-Gangetic Plain in the centre, and the table-land of Peninsular India in the south.</p>

<p>Although usually described as a continuous mass of mountains, the Himalayas are composed of numerous ranges lying roughly parallel to each other and separated and intersected by river valleys. The principal ranges are the following*:- The Geart Himalayan Range, lying almost in its entirety in British India, and stretching from the southward bend of the Brahmaputra in the east to that of the Indus in the west. In the west of Nepal it gives off a nothern range, the Zaskar, which extends nearly as far to the west as the main axis; and from its southern side come two ranges, the Dhauladhar, rising in Tehri Garhhwal and dying out near the source of the Chenab and stretching south of it, and of Srinagar as far as the Jhelum, where it gradually decreases in altitude. North of the Zaskar Range in Kashmir come in order from south to north the Ladak Range, which eastward forms part of the northern boundary of British India in Nepal and Bhutan, the rest of it being in Tibetan territory; the Kailas Range, which sweeps across Tibet to the north of Lhasa, forming the northern boundary of the lower-lying open country traversed by the Brahmaputra and, in the west, by the upper waters of the Sutlej and Indus, an area bounded on the south by the Ladak Range; and the Karakorum Range running from the Tibet boundary of British India in the north-west. The northern slopes of the Himalayas pass by means of a a stretch of upload grass into the high plateau of Tibet, and it is along the Tibetan frontier that the Holarctic element of open-country species enters the extreme north of Hindustan. On the southern slopes of the mountain range the conditions are different, ranging from arctic in the higher summits to tropical below the foothills, the vegetation passing gradually from alpine through temperate to evergreen forests and jungles.</p>

<p>All the numerous rivers which intersect and form passes through the main Himalayan Range, expect in the extreme east, are tributaries of the Indus and Ganges which give their name to the Indo-Gangetic Plain stretching across India from Sind to the north of the Bay of Bengal. In the lower Punjab and Sind this plain has low humidity and characteristic desert vegetation, Westward it extends through Baluchistan and Persia to Mesopotamia; but eastward, with increasing humidity, it gradually changes its character, passing finally into forest and into the jungly swamps and islets of the Sundarbans about the mouths of the Ganges and Brahmaputra. The Vindhya Hills and other northen ranges mark the rise of Peninsular India from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The greater part of it is a table-land consisting of hills and grass-covered plains intersected everywhere by the tributaries of its main rivers, which cross it from side to side, the Narmada and the Tapati in the north flowing from east to west, the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna,and the kauveri in a general way from west to east. Near the Carnatic and Malabar coasts it is flanked respectively by the Eastern and Western Ghats and outlying ranges. The Western Ghats, supplemented by the Nilgiri, Annamalai, and other hills, have a profound effect upon the general features of the Peninsula. They intercept the south-west monsoon causing expectionally heavy rainfall, mainly on their seaward slopes, depriving the country to the east of much mositure and converting it into a comparatively dry zone. Naturally the vegetation of the two areas is very different in accordance with the rainfall; where it is moderate to the east of the Ghats there are grass-covered plains, with clumps of acacias and stunted, mostly deciduous, trees, here and there forming copses or small forests. The seaward slopes of the Western Ghats, on the contrary, are mostly covered with dense forests of lofty evergreen trees, festooned with creepers and accompanied by luxuriant growths of bamboo. In the Nilgiris and other South Indian hill ranges there are wide, open, grass-covered areas broken up by thickly forested gorges or sholas*.</p>

<p>Ceylon in its physical features is like Southern India, of which it formed a part before the age of mammals. It is divided into three intergrading zones :- (1)A dry zone occupying roughly the whole of the northen, eastern, and south-eastern parts of the island, and consisting principally of low-lying, jungle - covered country with an annual rainfall of from 25 to 75 inches, falling mostly during the north-east monsoon. This zone in its physical features and mammalian fauna recalls the south-eastern area of Southern India.(2) A central hill zone consisting of plateaus and mountains, sometimes over 8000 feet, covered with virgin forest and grassland, with a rainfall of from 80 to 200 inches, generally distributed throughout the year.(3) A small, low country, wet zone to the south-west of the hill zone, consisting of low, forest-covered hills and broken country, with a rainfall of about 200 inches, falling mainly  during the south-west monsoon, although there are heavy storms during the north-east monsoon. This and the hill zone tolerably closely resemble the Malabar tract of southern India.</p>

<p>Burma*, which for long ages has formed a continuous land-area with China to the north and what is now the Malay Peninsula to the south, is less varied in its physical features than India and differs from it in some respects. It is intersected by rivers running mainly from north to south and separated by higher and lower hill-ranges forming the water-sheds of the tributaries that feed them. The central part, occupying about one-fourth of the country with a rainfall of only about 20 inches in the year, and vegetation that has been described as ``scrub-forest,'' is called the ``Dry-Zone.'' The greater part of the rest of the country has a much higher rainfall, reaching as much as 200 inches in the extreme south, and is mostly covered with heavy evergreen forest; but there are extensive areas of jungle grass, up to about 12 feet high, along the banks of the larger rivers and in other places  subject to inundations. Where the soil is poorer the grasses grow to about half that height; and many of the hill-tops, at an altitude of about 5000 feet or so, are often treeless and covered ith comparatively short grass.</p>

<p>The general trend of the rivers and hill-ranges from north to south offers no obstacle to the migration of the mammalian fauna in either direction; and the general uniformity of the forest conditions to the north and south of the dry zone results in corresponding similarity in the fauna throughout the forested areas. But the forested area of lower Tenasserim and the northern part of Peninsular Siam differs somewhat and some of its mammals are Malayan in type.</p>

<p>Of the Oriental Mammals, restricted, or  nearly so dagged, to the region, the following are the principal genera and species which occur in British India:- The Asiatic tapir (Acrocodia), rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros, Dicerorhinus), elephant (Elephas), buffalo (Anoa), dagged gaur and banteng (Bibos), nylghai (Boselaphus) four-horned antelope (Tetracerus), blackbuck (Antilope), serow (Capricornis), goral (N{\ae}mohedus), takin (Budorcas), sambhar (Rusa), chital and hog -deer (Axis), swamp-deer and thamin (Ruservus), muntjac (Muntiacus), mouse-deer and (Meminna, Tragulus), gibbons (Hylobates), leaf-monkeys (Semnopithecus, Presbytis, and two other genera), macaques (Macaca), lorises (Loris, Nycticebus), clouded leopard (Neofelis), marbled cat (Pardofelis), Temminck's cat (Profelis), leopard-cat, fishing cat, rusty spotted cat (Prionailurus), civets (Viverra, Moschothera, Viverricula), palm-civets (Paradoxurus, Paguma, Hemigalus, Arctogalidia), binturong (Arctictis), linsang (Prionodon), several species of mongoose (Herpestes), smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale), clawless otter (Amblonyx), hog-badger (Arctonyx), ferret-badger (Helictis), panda (Ailurus), sloth-bear (Melursus), black bear (Selenarctos), sun-bear (Helarctos), pangolions (Manis, Paramamis, Phatages), flying lemur or colgo (Galeopterus), tree- shrews (Tupaia and others), and many squirrels (Ratufa, Funambulus, Collosciurus, etc.), as well as many  additional rodents and several kinds of bats.</p>

<p>Mixed with the above-mentioned mammals, which help to stamp the distinctness of the Oriental Region, are many others identical with, or closely related to, species widely distributed in districts of central or south-western Asia, or both assigned to the Holarctic Region, or even in Africa. Many, indeed, of the most prominent members of the British Indian mammalian fauna come into  this category. Some, like the tiger, panther, jungle-cat, wild dog, jackal, and wild boar, occur in Burma as well as in Hindustan and, expect the tiger and wild dog, in Ceylon also. Others, found only to the west of the Bay of Bengal, but not in Ceylon, are the  lion, hunting leopard, caracal, desert-cat, hy{\ae}na, ratel, and chikara (gazelle), which are very nearly allied to similar  types occurring in south-western Asia and Africa, the smaller Indian  wolf, which ranges into Persia and Mesopotamia, and he tahr (Hemitragus), of which the three isloted species are found respectively in the Himalayas, the Nilgiri Hills, and southern Arabia. To this series should be added the desert fox, the wild ass or ghorkha, the Sind ibex, and the wild sheep or gad, which spread from Persia for a short distance into the plains and mountains  of valley of the Indus.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the mammals, both strictly Oriental and partly Holarctic, inhabiting Peninsular India and the Gangetic Plains are found in the Tarai, the foothills and the forest slopes of the Himalayas, some of them ascending to tolerably high altitudes. Of these the most important are the elephant, buffalo, gaur (bison) nylghai, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, sambhar, chital, hog-deer, swamp-deer, muntjac, wild boar, ratel, tiger, leopard, jungle-cat, leopard-cat, common palm-civet (toddy-cat), little civet, grey mongoose, Bengal fox, rhesus macaque, and entellus langur. They overlap several Oriental forms not found elsewhere to the west of the Bay of Bengal which have passed along the Himalayas from southern  China and Upper Burma, as recorded below. But although the dominance of Oriental forms puts this mountain range within the Oriental region, there is a strong Holarctic infusion  from Central Asia, especially in the western Himalayas, where typical Oriental types gradually disappear, although a few, like the leopard-cat, toddy-cat, yellow-throated marten, rhesus macaque, entellus, langur, and serow, occur in the hills of Kashmir.</p>

<p>Of these northern Holarctic immigrants into British Indian territory the most interesting are the Siberian ibex, the barasingh or Kashmir stag, and the shou, these two, representing the genus  <i>Cervus</i>, not found elsewhere within our limits, the musk-deer, blue sheep or bharal, the snow-leopard or ounce, the lynx. Pallas's cat, the hill-fox, Tibetan or woolly wolf, the red bear (<i>Ursus</i>), and several members of the weasel family, including the pine-marten and Siberian mink*.</p>

<p>Some of these, like the snow-leopard, bharal and musk-deer, and Siberian  mink, occur apparently throughout the Himalayan Range, the two first above the tree-line, the two last below it ; but most of them are restricted to the western portions, west of Nepal, although the hill-fox, reaches Sikkim. A few species, like the markhor, the hoary fox,and the ermine, penetrate British India for a comparatively short distance from Afghanistan and  the Hindu Kush. On the open, undulating plains to the north of the mountains, and as far west as Ladak, are found the yak, the chiru, the Tibetan gazelle, Hodgson's argali, the kiang, the Tibetan sand-fox, and the Tibetan polecat.</p> 

<p>As stated above, the mammals of the Indo-Gangetic Plain overlap those of the Himalayas, and in the west the desert types, which pass into Baluchistan. Southwards they similarly blend with those of Peninsular India, especially with those inhabiting the dry zone of this area. But, as might be expected, the hill ranges of the western and southern parts of the Peninsula, characterized by heavy rainfall and mostly by luxuriant forests, have some peculiar features in their mammalian fauna. The lion-tailed macaque, John's leaf-monkey , the stripe-necked and brown mongooses, Gwatkin's yellow-throated marten, and the Nilgiri ibex are typical forms. Of these the macaque is restricted to this district. the leaf-monkey and mongooses are the same as, or closely akin to, forms found in Ceylon, whereas the marten and the ibex have no allies in any part of Hindustan but the Himalayas.</p>

<p>There is no proof that Ceylon derived its mammalian fauna from any source but India. Within the the mammalian era there is geological evidence of two unions with that country. There may have been a connection during the Pliocene, which admitted some early types; but the first of the two unions above mentioned probably occurred during the Pleistocene Ice Age when the mammals of northern India were driven southwards and entered the Ceylonese area (see p.xxvi). Here, by the subsequent conversion of the area into an island, they were isolated for a time, and some of them at least became differentiated into the peculiar forms now characteristic of Ceylon. The second connection took place much later, and enduring until comparatively recently, possibly into historic times, admitted a fresh influx of Indian species and the northward migration of some Ceylonese forms into southern India. Theoretically the most differentiated of the existing Ceylonese species are the descendants of the earlier immigrants, whereas those that are at most slightly different from Indian species or indistinguishable from them probably came in on the second occasion.</p> 

<p>The mammal fauna of the island is interesting from many points of view, not the least being the light it throws on the period, earlier or later, of the occupatin of southern India by the species now found there. Some were sufficiently early, other were too late to avail themselves of the landbridge over what is now Palk Strait. Of the better-known Ceylonese forms that are identical with those found in S.India, or nearly allied to them, the following are the most important: the leaf-monkeys, macaques, loris, leopard, fishing-cat, rusty-spotted cat, jungle-cat, little civet, palm-civets, mongooses, jackal, otter, sloth-bear, pangolin, blacknaped hare, porcupine, many squirrels and other Rodents, and Insectivores of the Shrew family, wild boar, mouse-deer, muntjac, hog-deer, chital,  sambhar, buffalo, and elephant. Some of these forms, like the monkeys, loris, rusty-spotted cat, plam-civets of the <i>zeylonensis</i>  type, mongooses, bear, pangolin, hare, porcupine, mouse-deer, and chital, are restricted to Ceylon and India proper; and a few of them, namely, the leaf-monkey (Kasi), macaques, loris, rusty-spotted cat, palm-civets, two at least of the species of mongooses, hare, and mouse-deer, are found solely or mainly in the southern part of Peninsular India and Ceylon.</p>

<p>Of the Indian species that do not occur in Ceylon it is needless to refer to he northern types mostly restricted to the Himalayas. But there are many southern species, some found far to the south in Peninsular India, which arrived there after the final separation of the island or were excluded from it by other factors. The principal species are: the lion-tailed macaque, tiger, leopard-cat, caracal, hunting leopard, Malabar civet, hy{\ae}na, wild dog, fox, marten, ratel, tree-shrew, Nilgiri ibex, gazelle, blackbuck, four-horned antelope, nilghai, and gaur or bison.</p>

<p>Although a considerable number of familiar Indian mammals, like elephant, buffalo, gaur (bison), sambhar, hog-deer, barking deer (muntjac), wild boar, tiger, leopard, jungle-cat, fishing-cat, leopard-cat, small civet, common palm-civet (toddy-cat), jackal, wild dog, smooth-coated and clawless otter, and rhesus monkey, occur both in Burma and India, the mammalian fauna of Burma differs from that of India south of the Himalayas both on the negative and positive sides. On the negative side it is characterized by the absence of such species as the lion, hunting leopard, caracal, wolf,  hy{\ae}na, ratel, wild ass, sheep, goats, and gazelle, which came into India from the west, and of such typically Indian species as the nylghai, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, chital or spotted deer, swamp-deer, entellus-langur, sloth-bear, and pangolin. On the positive side Burma has a large number of genera which in India are not found south of the Himalayas, its fauna resembling especially that of the eastern part of China, Indo-China, and the rest of south-eastern Asia as far as Wallace's line. This resemblance is apparently due very largely to the migration of typically Chinese forms westwards along the Himalayas sometimes as far as Kashmir, and southwards through Burma, Indo-China, and Siam to Malaya and beyond*. The following are the principal genera and species, with their geographical distribution, which are found in Burma and mainly in the mountainous parts of northern India, but not in the plain of the Ganges or southward of it in India: gibbons, Assam to Borneo; pig-tailed macaque, Assam to Borneo; Assamese macaque, Nepal to Upper Burma and Tongking; stump-tailed macaque, Assam to Malaya; leaf-monkey (<i>Trachypithecus</i>) and slow loris, Assam to Borneo; Temminck's cat, Nepal to Burma, China, and Sumatra; the marbled cat China and to Borneo; the clouded leopard from Nepal to Tongking; the large civet from Nepal and China to Malaya; the large spotted civet from Burma to Malaya; the palm-civet (<i>Pyguma</i>) from Nepal to Borneo; the binturong from Sikkim to Palawan; the three-striped palm-civet from Assam to Borneo; the little  mongoose from Kashmir to Java*; the crab-eating mongoose from Nepal to China and Malaya; the yellow-throated marten from from Kashmir to China and Borneo; the Siberian mink from Kashmir to China and Sumatra; the striped weasel from Nepal to Indo-China and Lower Burma; the yellow-bellied weasel from Kashmir to China and Indo-China; the hog-badger from Sikkim to China and Sumatra; the ferret-badger from Nepal to China and Borneo; the Himalayan black bear from Baluchistan through Kashmir to China and Burma; the Malayan or sun-bear from Burma to Borneo; the panda, Nepal to China; the two-horned rhinoceros from Bhutan to Borneo; the lesser one-horned rhinoceros from Sikkim and the Sundarbans to Borneo; the banteng or tsain, Burma to Borneo; takin, Bhutan to China  Upper Burma; serow, Kashmir to China and Sumatra; the goral from Kashmir to China and Lower Burma; thamin or Eld's deer, Burma, Indo-China, Malaya dagged; pangolins, one from Nepal to China and Burma, the other from Burma to Borneo and Celebes.</p>

<p>In Tenasserim, as far north as the Y\'e River, the fauna has a marked, so-called Malayan element, represented by the tapir, Mergui to Sumatra; mouse-deer  (<i>Tragulus</i>), Tenasserim to Borneo; flying-lemur or colugo, Mergui to the Philippines; banded palm-civet, Tenasserim to Borneo; banded linsang, Tenasserim to Borneo; the leaf-monkey (<i>Presbytis</i>) Tavoy to Borneo. To these should probably be added as essentially southern types, although spreading into Lower Burma north and west of Tenasserim, the lar-gibbon, which is closely related to similar gibbons, spreading as far as Borneo, and the crab-eating macaque, which under a variety of forms reaches to the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>Since most of these mammals have no allied species in India south of the Himalayas, the contrast between the faunas of the two areas is profound. It is, however, lessened in a measure by kinship in a few instances. The pig-tailed macaque, for example has its nearest ally in the lion-tailed macaque of Malabar; the leaf-monkey (<i>Trachypithecus</i>) is nearly as closely akin to the leaf-monkey (<i>Khasi</i>) of south-western India and Ceylon, and the slow loris  and the Ceylonese and South Indian slender loris are the only genera of the lemurs found in the Oriental Region. Similarly, the mouse-deer or chevrotain      (<i>Tragulus</i>) Tenasserim and related genus (<i>Meminna</i>) of Peninsular India are the sole examples of that group of ruminants occurring within British Indian limits.The thamin or Eld's deer, and, incidentally  Schomburgk's deer, have their nearest ally in the swamp-deer of parts of Northern India; the large-spotted Burmese civet is closely related to the Malabar civet; and the common yellow- throated marten is represented by an allied species in Southern India.</p>

<p>The Andamans and Nicobars, a chain of mainly forested islands in the eastern part of the Bay of Bengal, and marking the site of an ancient land-bridge between the Pegu district of Burma and the northern point of sumatra, are also included in British India, and may be granted the staus of a separate tract, Characterized negatively by the absence of all the larger typically Oriental mammals and positively by the presence of between thirty and forty species or subspecies, mostly rats and bats, but all of them peculiar to the Archipelago, with the exception of a few, including the pig-tailed macaque (<i>M nemestrina leonina</i>), comparatively recently introduced by Europeans.</p>

<p>The islands are separated from the mainland of the Malay Peninsula by very deep sea, indicating long isolation dating back to a period before the Malayan  Region was occupied by its present mammalian fauna. But the species and subspecies inhabiting the islands belong to genera now found  on the mainland, and are comparatively slightly differentiated. From these facts Miller*  inferred that, with the exception of the bats, which reached the islands by flight, the forerunners of the rest of the mammals were imported by the early native  settlers and, like them, have become modified in the interval, into the existing types. Of these setting aside the Bats and Rats, there is a long -tailed macaque (<i>M.irus</i>) in the Nicobars related to Malayan and Sumatran races; a palm-civet (<i>Paguma</i>) in the Andamans; a wild boar (<i>Sus</i>), two shrews (<i>Crocidura</i>), one from the Andamans, the other from the Nicobars, and a tree-shrew (<i>Tupaia</i>) from the Nicobars which is more distinct from its mainland congeners than are the other peculiar forms.</p> 

<p>Reviewing the main above-described facts connected with the distribution of mammals in British India, with others supplied  by the rodents and other orders of smaller species, Blanford dagged assigned two areas of it to the Pal{\ae}arctic section of the Holarctic Region. These were the Punjab tract, including the deserts of Baluchistan, Sind, the Punjab, and western Rajputana up to a line running roughly from Cutch to the Himalayas nearly due north of Delhi, and the Tibetan tract, comprising the area to the north of the Himalayas through which the Indus and the Brahmaputra flow, and extending westward through Ladak to Gilgit.</p> 

<p>The rest of British India he referred to the Oriental Region, and divided it into two subregions named, not very appropriately, the Cisgangetic and the Transgangetic. The Cisgangetic extends westwards from the ill-defined boundary of the Punjab tract to the Bay of Bengal and the hills forming the eastern limit of the alluvial deposits of the Ganges and Brahmaputra and, from north to south, from the base of the Himalayas to Caps Comorin, with the addition of Ceylon. This Subregion was further subdivided into several subordinate tracts, of which the only one that calls for special notice is the Malabar tract, the wet zone running along the western side of the Peninsula from the Tapati to Cape Comorin. of the island belonging to the tract of Southern Peninsular India of which the Krishna is the northern boundary.</p>

<p>The Transgangetic subregion is composed of the Himalayas from Kashmir to Bhutan, Assam, Manipur, Tipperah, Chittagong, and the whole of Burma*.</p>

<p>This subregion, like the Cisgangetic, is subdivided into several tract, of Which the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are one, but the most distinct perhaps is the Malayan tract, including Tenasserim from the Y\'e River, as Mr. H.C.Smith tells me, not Mergui, as thought by Blanford, southwards to Victoria Point.</p>  

<p>Blanford sought to explain the peculiarities in the distribution of the existing mammals of British India as resulting from the Pleistocene Ice Age and  the subsequent return of warmer conditions. At. the present time the glaciers in Sikkim do not extend below about 14,000 feet; but there is proof that during cold spell they descended as low as 7,000 feet in that district, and even to lower levels in the western Himalayas. Hence this mountain range was evidently at that time much colder than it is now, and a considerable area of Northern India to the south of it must have been correspondingly affected, giving rise to conditions unsuitable for the survival of the tropical forms that swarmed there before the onset of the Ice Age, and were either exterminated or driven southwards as it progressed. Later, with the gradual return of the warmer conditions such as now prevail over all the areas affected by cold, facilities were afforded for the reoccupation of the higher levels of the Himalayas by such species as had survived at the base and by others from the four main points of the compass, and for the return to Northern India of the descendants of the species that had taken refuge in Southern India.</p>

<p>Some such theory as this affords apparently the most plausible explanation of certain features in the distribution of mammalian life in British India, especially of those supplied by the wide geographical separation between some related forms in the Transgangetic subregion and in the southern part of the Cisgangetic subregion, which are severed by a large tract of Central and Northern India-species and genera of which the ancestors formerly, it may be assumed, were continuously distributed in the northern portions of the Oriental Region. Instances of this phenomenon have already been cited. The most important illustrations of it are the following:-The pig-tailed macaque, ranging from Assam to Borneo, and the lion-tailed macaque of the Malabar tract; the common leaf-monkey of Assam and Burma, which also  spread to Borneo, and John's leaf-monkey of the Malabar tract and its related Ceylonese species; the slow loris, another species ranging from Assam to Borneo, and the slender loris of South India and Ceylon; the large-spotted Burmese and Indo-Chinese civet and the Malabar civet; the mouse-deer, ranging from Tenasserim to Borneo, and its related genus of Southern India and Ceylon. Finally the common yellow throated marten, found practically all over the Transgangetic subregion, and the thar of Himalayas are represented in some of the hill ranges of Southern India respectively by Gwatkin's marten and the Nilgiri ibex, These species in particular, and especially the ibex, might perhaps be cited as cogent evidence of the truth of Blanford's hypothesis regarding the effects of the Ice Age on distribution of the mammalian fauna of British India.</p>

<p><b>MAMMALIA.</b></p>

<p>A CLASS of vertebrated animals distinguished from the Reptilia, its next of kin and ancestral stock, by a number of characters of which the most important perhaps are the presence of hairs, instead of scales, in the skin, and of mammary or milk-glands in the female for the nourishment of the young after birth. Other differences are the separation of the cavity of the chest of thorax from that of the abdomen by a complete respiratory muscular sheet or diaphragm, the division of the heart into four chambers, and the presence of a single great blood-vessel, the aorta or aortic arch, by which the blood is driven from the heart to the various organs; these modifications of the respiratory and normally keeps the body-temperature at a uniform level and above that of the surrounding medium, air or water, however cold.In the skull the most important difference lies in the lower jaw, which consists of a single bone jointed  directly to the skull, the subsidiary intervening bones, present in existing reptiles, being taken into the ear, some as auditory ossicles subservient to hearing.</p>

<p>To explain the technical terms used for defining the orders and subordinate groups into which mammals have been classified it is necessary to describe some of the external and skeletal characters.</p>

<p>The normal hairy covering, occasionally represented to a certain extent by spines, still more rarely by plate-like scales, and lost in the CETACEA, usually consists of two elements, the superficial (contour) hairs and the underwool. On the head the hairs of certain definite areas are modified as tactile  bristles (<i>vibriss{\ae}</i>) arranged in tufts on the Upper lip (mystacial), over the eye (superciliary), on the cheek (genal), on the chin (submental), and on the fore-throat (interramal). These are found in so many orders that they may be regarded  as primitive. Two additional, probably primitive, organs on the head are (i) the area of moist naked skin round the nostrils (<i>rhinarium</i>), which generally has a narrow extension (<i>philtrum</i>) running to the edge of the upper lip in front and dividing it into a right and left portion, and (ii) the external ear (<i>pinna</i>), a hollowed extension of the skin supported by cartilage, and generally strengthened by ridges of lobes of the same material. It varies greatly in size, shape, and other particulars, and may be altogether lost. The edges of its cavity below typically meet to form a notch (<i>intertragal</i>); just above this in front there is commonly a lobe (<i>tragus</i>), and behind another lobe (<i>antitragus</i>), and the principal strengthening ridge (<i>supratragus</i>) lies longitudinally above these within the cavity. Further modifications will be described under the different headings where necessary.</p>

<p>Fig. 1.-A. Right ear of Hunting Leopard : <i>b</i>, bursa ; <i>st</i>, supratragus ; <i>it</i>, intratragus; <i>t</i>, tragus; <i>in</i>, intertragal notch. B.Rhinarium of Large Indian Civet, from the front : <i>in</i>, infranarial portion beneath nostril; <i>ph</i>, philtrum. C. Side view of head of Indian Jackal, showing tufts of facial vibriss{\ae}: <i>s</i>, superciliary; <i>g</i> and <i>g</i>, upper and lower genal ; mystacail; <i>sm</i>, submental; <i>r</i>, interramal.</p>

<p>The modifications of the feet supply important systematic characters. The primitive type of foot has five toes of digits (pentadactyle), the inner digit being the first, the outer the fifth. The terminal segment of each is provided above with a compressed claw, a flattish nail or a hoof, an expanded nail embracing the front and generally the sides of the segment. The sole in the primitive foot is naked from the tips of the digits to the wrist and ankle or heel, and is supplied with paad on the digits the pads (<i>digitals</i>) are restricted to the terminal segment. The rest of the pads, six in number, are on the sole. Four of them (<i>interdigitals</i>) are just behind the spaces between the digits. Frequently three of them, sometimes four, coalesce to form a large submedian pad (<i>plantar</i>). The remaining two, an outer and an inner, are near the wrist of the fore foot (<i>carpal</i>) and towards the heel of the hind foot (<i>metatarsal</i>), When the sole is overgrown with hair the pads may be wholly lost. The gait of a mammal walking on the greater part of the sole is called plantigrade, on the toes, with the heel and wrist well off the ground, digitigrade, and on the hoofs alone, unguligrade; but there is no  sharply defined difference between these methods.</p>

Right fore foot, showing the digital pads at the tips of the toes: 1 and 4, the internal and external interdigital pads; <i>c</i>, the internal carpal pad; <i>cv</i>,turf of carpal vibriss{\ae}, a primitive mammalian feature. B. The hind foot, with similar pads; <i>mt</i>, the external metatarsal,</p>

<p>The generative organs are also extensively used in classification, but only recently to the extent their importance demands. The area between them and the anus is the perin{\ae}um. In the male the intromittent organ of penis frequently has a thickened termination, the glans; and it may be strengthened by an internal, rod-shaped  bone, the <i>baculum</i>. The sack of skin into which the testes may descend is the scrotum. In the female the generative orifice has tumid lips or labia, and between these and above the urinary orifice is an organ, the clitoris, which corresponds to the penis of the male.</p>

<p>In the skeleton the skull is the most important part. It consists of a large number of bones, the lines of contact between them being the <i>sutures</i>.  As age advances and the bones fuse the sutures tend to become obliterated. For convenience the skull may be divided into two parts: (i) the facial, including  the muzzle and the eye-sockets or orbits, and (ii) the cranial, which lodges the brain. The muzzle is made up of the lower and upper jaws. The two halves of the lower jaw or <i>mandible</i> meet in front in a symphysis; behind they are jointed to the skull by a condyle; below the condyle there is usually a process, the angular, and above it a wide flange, the coronoid, to which the great masticatory muscle, the temporal, is attached. These are parts of the postdental portion of the mandible, the rest being the dental or tooth-bearing portion in front. The upper jaw contains a spacious cavity, opening in front  by the <i>anterior nares</i> and behind, in the back of the mouth, by the <i>posterior nares</i>. The cavity is roofed above by the <i>nosals</i>, enclosed at the sides by the <i>maxill{\ae}</i>, the anterior nares being bordered laterally and below by the <i>premaxill{\ae}</i>. The floor of the cavity, which also forms the roof of the mouth, is composed of the premaxill{\ae} in front, the maxill{\ae} in the middel, and the <i>palatines</i> behind. The palate is typically pierced by two pairs of orifices, one, larger, in front; the other, smaller, behind, known respectively as the <i>anterior</i> and <i>posterior</i>  palatine <i>foramina</i>. The cavity of the nasal chamber is largely occupied by two pairs of delicate, sponge-like bones, the <i>maxillo-turbinals</i> in front and the <i>ethmoturbinals</i> behind.</p>

<p>Fig.3.-Upper and lower sides of left half of skull of Indian Jackal, with names of bones, teeth and other features referred to in text. Upper side: <i>pmx</i>, premaxilla; <i>nas</i>, nasal; <i>max</i>, maxilla; <i>mal</i>, malar bone of zygomatic arch (<i>zyg</i>).; <i>fr</i>, frontal; <i>pop</i>, frontal postorbital process; <i>orb</i>, orbit; <i>sq</i>, squamosal branch of zygomatic arch; <i>par</i>, parietal; <i>mast</i>, mastoid; <i>ocr</i>, occipital crest; <i>sag</i>, sagittal crest; <i>tr</i>, temporal ridge. Lower side: lettering as above, with <i>apf</i> and <i>ppf</i>, anterior and posterior palatine foramina; <i>pal</i>, palatine; <i>mf</i>, mesopterygoid fossa; <i>ham</i>, hamular process of pterygoid; <i>ptc</i>, external pterygoid crest; <i>bul</i>, auditory bulla; <i>fm</i>, foramen magnum; <i>oc</i>, occipital condyle; <i>poc</i>, paroccipital process; <i>ao</i>, auditory orifice; <i>gl</i>, glenoid;  <i>fo</i>, foramen ovale; <i>als</i>, alisphenoid canal, marked by arrow; teeth: <i>i</i>, incisors; <i>c</i>, canine; <i>pm1</i> to <i>pm2</i>, premolars;   <i>m1</i>, <i>m2</i>, molars.</p>

<p>On the facial part of the maxilla below and in front of the orbit there is usually a well-defined orifice, the <i>infraorbital foramen</i>, through which nerves and blood-vessels pass to the upper lip. Usually within the front rim of the orbit is the <i>lacrymal foramen</i>. From the cheek below the eye to the ear runs a stout bar of bone, the <i>zygomatic arch</i>, the anterior part of which, consisting of the <i>malar</i> bone, forms the lower rim of the orbit, and its posterior part composed of a forwardly directed process from the squamosal, a bone forming the wall of the lower part of the cranium above the ear, forms the outer edge of a space, the temporal fossa, which usually communicates with the orbit in front.</p>

<p>The cranial cavity is roofed in front by a pair of <i>frontal bones</i>, each of which is usually produced at the side into a <i>postorbital process</i>, which sometimes meets a corresponding process rising from the malar part of the zygomatic arch to complete the ring round the orbit. Two roofing bones behind the frontals are the <i>parietals</i>. These with the frontals to a lesser extent, give attachment to the masticatory temporal muscle on each side, and the edge of the muscle is typically marked by the temporal ridge, which extends from the postorbital process to the back of the skull. Not infrequently the ridges creep up to the summit of the skull with age and, coalescing. may rise into a high <i>sagittal crest</i> to support the muscle. The back of the skull is mainly formed by the occipital bone, which encircles the orifice, <i>foramen magnum</i>, through which the spinal cord passes, and on each side of this is the <i>occipital condyle</i>, by which the skull is jointed to the neck. The upper part of this bone is usually provided with a transverse curved <i>occipitalcrest</i> for supporting the muscles of the neck. The floor of the skull just in front of the foramen magnum is formed by the <i>basioccipital</i>, and the space between this and the squamosal, to which the mandible is jointed, is occupied by bones connected with the ear usually a swelling, the auditory bulla, connected with the auditory orifice, and behind this frequently a projection, the mastoid, and behind the bulla, or pressed against it, is a process from the occipital, the <i>paraccipital</i>.</p>

<p>The base of the skull in front of the areas just described and behind the palate is occupied by a pit, the <i>mesopterygoid fossa</i>, into which the posterior nares open. The side walls of this are formed by the palatine bones in front and the <i>pterygoids</i> behind, the latter sometimes running into a distinct process, the <i>hamular</i>. In the base of the skull, adjoining, there are typically four orifices for the exit of nerves from the brain, forming a series from the middle of the temporal fossa backwards, and named the optic foramen, the <i>sphenoidal fissure</i>, the <i>foramen rotundum</i>, and the last, the <i>foramen ovale</i>, a little in front of the auditory bulla.</p>

<p>The <i>teeth</i> supply important characters for distinguishing mammals of all ranks, at least from genera to orders. The full complement of teeth in  normal adult mammals is generally considered to be 11 on each side above and below, differentiated into four categories-3 incisors, 1 canine, 4 premolars, and 3 molars, represented by the formula above and below for one side:  i.3/3, c.1/1, pm.4/4. m.3/3 In only a few genera of Oriental mammals is this number retained above and below, the reduction affecting alike the teeth of all four categories. In the upper jaw the incisors are the teeth present in the premaxill{\ae}. The rest, from the canines backwards, are lodged in the maxill{\ae}, and are sometimes collectively called the ``cheek-teeth.'' The premolars and molars cannot always be distinguised by their form and structure. The difference lies in the premolars, like the canines and incisors, having predecessors in the milk dentition, the molars being unrepresented in the first set. In the lower jaw the teeth are developed in a single bone, and the incisors are identified by their correspondence with those of the upper jaw. The lower canine always passes or lies in front of the upper when the jaw is closed. This position enables it to be distinguished from the first premolar in some mammals, where the lower canine resembles the incisors and the first premolar is canine like. Similarly tusk-like teeth in the front of the upper jaw are determined as incisors or canines in accordance with their emergence in the premaxilla or maxilla.</p>    

<p>A normal individal tooth consists of the root or roots imbedded in the bone of the jaw and of the crown projecting beyond it. It  is developed from a pulp buried in the bone, and during its growth the root remains open at its lower end In most cases the root closes and growth of the tooth ceases by the time it is brought into use. Such teeth are commonly short, and the condition is called <i>brachyodent</i>. But sometimes the roots remain open and the tooth continues to grow after it is in use, so that the effects of wear are made good, at all events until old age is reached. Such teeth, generally deeply  imbedded and long, are called <i>hypsodont</i>. The crowns are still more variable in structure. Like the roots, they are composed mainly of ``dentine,'' but they are typically coated with a layer of hard enamel, and outside the enamel there is in some cases a third substance, the cement. These three successive layers are mainfest in the worn molar teeth of such animals as Elephants. The crowns of the teeth, especially of the posterior cheek-teeth, are typically provided with define cusps or tubercles varying in size and number, and there is a theory, called the ``tritubercular theory,'' by no means always accepted, that in early mammals the upper and lower teeth carried three cusps arranged, not in line, but in a triangle, the upper having two outer and one inner cusp  and the lower two inner and  one outer, so that they interlocked when the mouth was closed. In the upper tooth the inner cusp is called the <i>protocone</i>, the anterior of the two outers the <i>paracone</i>, and the posterior the <i>metacone</i>. In the lower tooth the outer cusp is the <i>protoconid</i>, the anterior inner the <i>paraconid</i>, and the posterior inner the <i>metaconid</i>. These cusps can be homologized in the teeth of many existing mammals; but the crown is generally complicated by accessory cusps which may be developed, apparently, even on the <i>cingulum</i>,a thickened ridge of enamel, often traceable, encircling the base of the crown. Teeth indeed are extremely plastic organs, apparently very responsive to diet, and may be totally dissimilar in mammals otherwise tolerably closely resembling one another in structure*.</p>

<p>The rest of the skeleton may be briefly dismissed. The vertebral column, or ``backbone,'' extending from the front of the neck to the tail-tip, and consisting of a series of bones mostly freely jointed together, is divided into several regions. The neck or cervical vertebr{\ae}, seven in number in all Indian mammals, have no ribs. A dozen or more of these that follow, the dorsal vertebr{\ae}, carry ribs most of which are attached below to a series of bones, the <i>sternum</i>. This region of the body is the <i>thorax</i>. Behind the last rib-bearing vertebra is a ribless series called the lumber vertebr{\ae}, which are the only ones in the abdominal region. Then come a few vertebr{\ae} welded together to form the <i>sacrum</i>, to which the <i>pelvis</i> is attached; the caudal vertebr{\ae} of the tail, varying in number in accordance with length of that organ, complete the series.</p>

<p>To the <i>scapula</i> or shoulder-blade on each side of the fore part of the thorax the fore limb is jointed, and in mammals in which this limb is capable of movement in various directions there is a collar-bone or <i>clavicle</i>, usually running from the lower end of the scapula to the front of the sternum. The fore limb consists of a single upper bone or <i>humerus</i>, jointed at its lower end to two bones, an inner, the <i>radius</i>, and an outer, the <i>ulna</i>,the upper and of the latter forming the elbow prominence. These bones at their lower ends are jointed to the  wrist or <i>carpus</i>, composed of two rows of small bones which give great mobility to the fore foot. This primitively consisted of five <i>metacarpals</i> jointed to the wrist and more or less welded together, and five toes or digits, all of which, except the first, the <i>pollex</i>, which has only two, are formed of three bones,the <i>phalakges</i>.</p> 

<p>The bony structure, or <i>pelvis</i>, supporting the hind limb is more complicated than that of the fore limb because it has other functions. It consists of three bones indistinguishably welded in the adult, the upper, <i>ilium</i>, which is nearly immovably attached to the sacrum, and two lower, the <i>pubis</i> in front and the <i>ischium</i> behind. These two bones encircle a large orifice, the <i>obtutator foramen</i>, and are not only joined below it, but are almost always united to their fellows of the opposite side, forming the <i>symphysis pubis</i>. At the point where the three bones meet is the socket, or <i>acetabulum</i>, for the hind limb, the individual bones of which correspond to those of the fore limb; the upper, or thigh bone, is the <i>femur</i>, the two below it the <i>tibia</i> and <i>fibula</i>, representing respectively the <i>radius</i> and <i>ulna</i>  of the fore arm; the ankle is the <i>tarsus</i>, of which one of the bones, the <i>calcaneum</i>, forms the heel or hock prominence, and the main body of the foot is composed primitively of five <i>metatarsals</i>, followed by five toes or digits, of which the first is called the <i>hallux</i>, with the same number of phalanges as in the fore foot. In mammals with very specialized limbs, like the Horses, Deer, and Antelopes, the bones above mentioned, both above and below the Carpus and tarsus, may be profoundly modified.</p>

<p>*The best instance of this, perhaps, is supplied by the Striped Hy{\ae}na and the Aard Wolf of Africa, which are beyond doubt nearly related, yet have  widely different premolar and molar teeth. The Aard Wolf feeds mainly on white ants, whereas the Hy{\ae}na feeds mainly on dead mammals.</p>

<p>From the primitive type, which may be pictured as a smallish, normally hairy, long-tailed, short-limbed mammals, with pentadactyle, clawed, padded feet, a rhinarium, facial  vibriss{\ae}, and pinna, which had inherited from its reptilian ancestor the capacity for running, climbing, and swimming, the mammals in the course of their evolution have become adapted to living under all the physical conditions the world supplies where food was obtainable, apart from certain places, like  New Zealand, which the sea prevented the terrestrial species from reaching. On land some have become specialized for rapid movement on the surface, others for burrowing beneath it; others, availing themselves of their climbing powers, took to living in trees, and fro arboreal species of different kinds were evolved those with the capacity for flight, which in the case of Bats is equal to that of birds. From the land, too, taking advantage  of the innate faculty for swimming, some invaded streams, rivers, and lakes, and from aquatic species were derived marine forms which, in the case of the Dugongs and Whales, are as nearly completely fitted for life in the sea  as the fishes. But varied modes of life are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In several of the more generalized mammals partly terrestrial,  partly aquatic, and partly arboreal habits are combined.</p>

<p>Adaptation to the different environments above sketched  has been accompanied in mammals by a range of variation in structure surpassing that of the existing members of the other classes of Vertebrates. By their modifications they have been classified into a number of different orders. Some of these, like the Bats, Whales, Dugongs, and  Elephants, for instance, stand apart from the rest, isolated as living animals by the extinction of ancestral linking forms. These orders are easy to define. But in other cases, owing to the survival of comparatively primitive species, the ordinal differences are not equally definite, and some of the  differentiating  characters used in the following Key may seem comparatively trivial. They are, however, accompanied by others mentioned in the main text, where necessary.</p>

<p>It need only be added that, apart from the Monotremes of Australia, the Marasupials of Australia and America, the Edentates of America, the HYRACOIDEA  and he TUBULIDENTATA (Aard Varks) of Africa, all the usually admitted orders of Mammals are found in British India.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of orders over those admitted by Blanford and the change in some of the names are due to the dismemberment of the Colugos as DERMOPTERA from the INSECTIVORA and to the substitution for his UNGULATA of the three orders ARTIODACTYLA for the ``even-toed'' or ''clovenfooted'' mammals, of PROBOSCIDEA for the Elephants. This is in accordance with recent opinion. Also it is now admitted that the Scaly Anteaters of Pangolins of Africa and Asia are not related to the Anteaters of S.America, which, with the Sloths and Armadillos, compose the true Edentata. The resemblance is merely a matter of diet-adaptation. The Pangolins are now called the PHOLIDOTA. Another order, MENOTYPHLA, might have been introduced by separating the Tree-Shrews from the INSECTIVORA.</p>

<p>Order PRIMATES.</p>

<p>As stated in the analytical Key, this order is mainly distinguished from the others constituting the mammalian fauna of British India by the large size, freedom of movement, and opposability of the first digit of the foot, the hallux or ``great toe,'' so that this extremity forms a powerful grasping organ  subservient to climbing*. In the first digit, the pollex or `` thumb,'' may be equally large and similarly functional, as in the Lorises, but in the Apes and Monkeys it is not so large as the other digits, and its opposability is useful rather for picking up food than for climbing. Associated with the freedom of movement of the arms and legs for climbing or other purposes are certain skeletal characters, namely, the presence of complete collar-bones, or clavicles and the distinctness of the two bones of the forearm, radius, and ulna, and of the shin, the tibia, and fibula. The teeth do not exceed 36 in number, the formula of the complete set being: i.2/2, c.1/1, pm.3/3 There are always two pairs of incisors above and below, and the medians are larger than the laterals. The upper canines are always well developed and tusk-like, at least in the male, and the lower also in the Apes and Monkeys, but not in the Lemuroids. The first lower premolar is larger than the rest and acts as a sharpener to the hind edge of the upper canine, and in the Lemuroids is itself sharp and canine-like. The back cheek-teeth have board crushing crowns, with four cusps, and are more complex than those in front behind the canines.</p>

<p>In his classification of the Mammalia, Man very naturally gives pride of place to this order containing himself and his next of kin, as indicated by its name. This position is only justified by the brain development and the intelligence that goes with it of some of the most specialized of its members. But this does not apply to the more ``bestial'' forms like the Lemuroids, and the organization of the order as a whole is much less specialized than in several others.</p>

<p>*Only one other order has a similar type of foot namely, the MARSUPIALIA of Australia and America. I long ago suggested the possibility of this resemblance being of genetic importance. As adaptive modifications to special methods of climbing the hallux in the PRIMATES is sometimes reduced in size. It is comparatively small, for instance, in the Orang-utan; and in the diminutive S.American Marmosets, which leap about trees like Squirrels, it is so small as to be nearly functionless, although still opposable.</p>

<p><i>Key to the principal Subdivisions of British Indian Primates.</i></p>

   <i>\'a</i>.Muzzle with distinct rhinarium and with lips adherent to the gum, not protrusible; skull with orbit open behind and front teeth abnormal   .                                [p.163.LEMUROIDEA,</p>
   
<p>The characters of the family Hominid{\ae} (Man), belonging to the  ANTHROPOMORPHA, are not included in this Key. The characters of the  PLATYRHINI, containing the American Monkeys, are entered  by way contrast with the CATARHINI, but the group is not included in the Indian fauna. </p>
 
<p>Suborder <i>PITHECOIDEA</i>*.</p>

<p>No <i>rhinarium</i>  or area of moist skin round the nostrils, with its extension below, as the <i>philtrum</i>, to the edge of the upper lip; the lip;  not closely adherent to the gum, but protrusible.</p>

<p>Hands and feet with the 4th digit not longer than the 3rd, which, more noticeably on the hand, is typically longer than the 2nd and  4th. Foot with its 2nd digit never differentiated from the rest by its claw-like nail. The tongue without a sublingua or serrated lamina beneath it.</p>

<p>Skull with the orbit shut off from the temporal fossa by a bony plate, leaving merely a narrow communicating cleft below it. Lower canine not projecting forwards and incisiform, the lower incisors not forming a comb-like structure and the median upper incisors not widely separated in the middle line.</p>

<p>This suborder, with the TARSIOIDEA, constitutes the section of Haplorhine Primates, Characterized by the structure of the nose, and upper lip, by the closed orbit, and other specialized features distinguishing them from the more primitive Strepsirhine Lemurs (p.164). <i>Tarsius</i>, however, which does not occur west of Java, shows several superficial resemblances to the African Galagos, related to the Lorises (p.164). and was formerly always regarded as a Lemuroid. Its survival as a representative of the primitive stock of Pithecoids, linking them in a measure with the Lemuroids, justifies the retention of the LEMUROIDEA in the Primates instead of their relegation to a special order, the PROSIMI{\AE}.</p>

<p>The Pithecoid Primates are divisible into two groups, the PLATYRHINI or American Monkeys and Marmosets, and the CATARHINI or Monkeys and Apes of Africa and Asia and Man.</p>

<p>*In 1918 I proposed this subordinal name as a substitute for the older name Anthropoidea because ``Anthropoid,'' reasonably according to its meaning, has been consistently applied to man-like Apes, and because ``Anthropoid'' cannot with any approach to its real significance be applied to, <i>e</i>. <i>g</i>., a Marmoset. But Marmoset and a man are alike Pithecoid or monkey-like.</p>

<p>CATARHINI.</p>

<p>Distinguished from the PLATYRHINI by the presence of a bony tube to the ear and by having only two premolar teeth above and below on each side, the dental formula being: i.2/2, c. 1/1, pm.2/2, m. 3/3=32 instead of i.2/2, c.1/1, pm. 3/3, m.3/3 or 2/2=36 or 32, the numerical equality in the latter case being reached by the loss of the 3rd molar in the Marmosets. In the CATARHINI also periotic bone is always perforated by the carotid canal, marked by a  conspicuous foramen, whereas in the PLATYRHINI the artery usually enters the brain behind the periotic. The external differences are not so important, but the thumb in the Catarhines is more opposable and prehensile and the nostrils are typically narrower and more convergent at their lower ends than in the Platyrhines, which take that name from the normally wider space between the nostrils.</p>

<p>Section <i>ANTHROPOMORPHA</i>.</p>

<p>THE MAN-LIKE APES.</p>

<p>This section of the Catarhine Primates, comprising the species to which the term ``Apes'' is now conventionally restricted, is distinguished by the absence of all external trace of the tail, by the great development of the arms, which are much longer than the legs, by the thumb being more freely jointed to the hand and emerging close to the wrist, with its basal thickening, the the ``ball of the thumb,'' approximately on a level with the external metacarpal pad; the foot has its heel broader in proportion to its length, and the pads on the palms and soles are poorly developed.</p>

<p>PITHECOIDEA.</p>

<p>These characters are associated with marked peculiarities both in arboreal and terrestrial activity. In walking in the quadrupedal attitude the palms of the hands are never applied to the ground, the bent knuckles of the fingers being  used instead, end the entire sole of the foot, or its outer edge, supports the hind quarters, which, as compared with the shoulders, are weak and light.In the young at least the erect bipedal attitude is really assumed for standing , walking, or even running. In tree-climbing, when speed is required, the powerful arms  are principally employed for swinging from branch, the legs being too weak for long leaps. This method of climbing has been called <i>brachiation </i>.</p>

<p>Fig.6.-A.Right hand of Lar Gibbon (<i>Hylobates lar</i>). B.Right foot of the same.</p>

<p>To the ANTHROPOMORPHA belong the Gorilla and Chimpanzee of Africa and the Orang-utan and Gibbons  of the Oriental Region. They are essentially forest animals. The Gibbons alone, constituting the family Hylobatid{\ae}, occur in the British Indian fauna*.</p>

<p> <b>Family HYLOBATIDAE</b>.</p>

<p>THE GIBBONS.</p>

<p>Apes with ischial callosities invariably present and well developed, the arms and legs, especially the arms, relatively long, with long and narrow hands and feet and long, slender digits, the pollex, or thumb, very long  and, when closed, fitting into a depression on the adjoining surface of the hand, the hallux, or ``great toe,'' also long and, when closed, overlapping the distal margin of the sole of the foot. No striking secondary sexual characters, the two sexes being to all intents and purposes alike in size and skull characters, the  {\female} having enlarged canines, which at most are only a little smaller  than those of the {\male} The skull has a larger cranial and smaller facial portion, with weaker jaws, than in Asiatic Catarhine monkeys.</p>

<p>In the almost complete absence of secondary sexual characters the Gibbons differ from all the other families of Catarhine Primates.</p>

<p>Although less man-like than the other Anthropoid Apes in mental capacity, and in some, but by no means all, structural characters, thus coming nearer the ordinary Monkeys, the Gibbons surpass the other Apes in physical activities, manifested by their ability to walk and run with facility in an erect attitude  on the ground and by the extent to which they have perfected the arm-swinging method of traversing the forest. In these and other habits all the species of Gibbons seem to be alike or to differ only in minor particulars.</p>

<p>On the ground they are essentially bipeds, standing and walking on the flat sole of the foot, with the great toe projecting sideways as a 
support, and, when hurried, either running with considerable speed, although with a somewhat awkward gait and not so fast as man, or  
progressing with a series of leaps, the two legs acting in unison. When thus on the move they may lightly touch the ground with the 
fingers to steady themselves; but almost always they hold the arms up, outstretched, but bent at the elbows and and wrist, and bent at the 
elbows and wrist, and employ them as balancers. So accurate is the balance that Gibbons can walk along the branch of a tree or, as 
observed in captive specimens, even along a swaying, horizontal rope, grasping it with their prehensile feet.</p>

<p>Equally remarkable are the means they employ and the speed they attain when traversing forest trees. With a jump off the upper side of a branch they launch themselves towards another, grasp it with upstretched hand, swing beneath it and, letting go, are carried on to another, which continued from branch to branch at great speed. When arresting their course they retain the hold of the branch and, swinging up on its further side, alight on their feet on its upper surface. Naturally they also climb slowly about tree after the manner of other Anthropoid Apes, but the method above described is the method 
adopted when speed is required. No other Pithecoid Primate is capable of such arboreal acrobatic feats, and none but man can exhibit such terrestrial bipedal activity.</p> 

<p>Another habit they have in common is howling vociferously from the tree-tops for two or three hours after sunrise, then quietly resting or feeding till towards sundown, when a briefer concert is indulged in before retiring to rest on the branches. Their diet consists mainly of leaves, flowers, and fruits, varied with some spiders and insects; and their usual method of drinking from a pool is to dip the back of the hand in the water and lick it off with the tongue, but occasionally they suck up the liquid direct with their lips.</p> 

<p>The period of gestation is seven months (see p.31).</p>

<p>Final agreement as to the value of the characters by which the various kinds of Gibbons that have been named differ from each other has not yet been reached by systematists. But the latest classification of the family by Miller (Journ. Mamm.xiv, p.159, 1933) establishes the existence of at all events five well-marked species which, so far as is known, do not intergrade, and are given subgeneric rank. These  are: <i>H.lar</i> and <i>H. hoolock</i>, representing <i>Hylobates</i> (sensu stricto); <i>H. leucogenys,</i> subgenus <i>Naomascus</i>, from Siam and Indo-China; <i>H klossii</i> subgenus <i>Brachitanytes</i>, the dwarf Gibbons of S.Pagi Island, west coast of Sumatra; and <i>H.syndoctylus</i>, subgenus <i>Symphalangus</i>, the Siamang of Sumatra and the  Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p>The two British Indian species belong to <i>Hylobates</i> (s.s).</p>

<p>Type of the genus, Homo lar Linn.</p>

<p>Distribution.-From ASSAM and BURMA to Siam and Indo-China, and through the Malay States and Sunda Islands to Borneo.</p>

<p>Distinguished from the species constituting the subgenera <i>Nomasus, Brachitanytes</i>, and <i>Symphalangus</i>, as defined by Miller, by one or more of the following characters:-Hair on the crown directed backwards, longer laterally than mesially; laryngeal sac absent, in both sexes and the throat not noticeably thinly haired; the scrotum absent, the testicles in the adult only descending to the base of the penis, but not below it. Skull with its facial profile tolerably strongly concave between the top of the nasal and the summit of the prominent browridge*.</p>

<p>The diagnosis applies to the two British Indian species and to the three forms <i>agilis, leuciscus</i>, and <i>mulleri</i> from the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, which, with skulls like those of <i>lar</i> but differing in coloration, I regarded as sub species of it (Proc.Zool.Soc.1929, p.117) gave reasons for considering them specifically distinct, an opinion apparently endorsed by Miller.</p>

<p>The two species occurring in British India may be briefly distinguished as follows:-</p>

<p><i>a</i>.Hands and feet the same colour as the arms and legs; 
            black phase with a pale brow-band, but the face not encircled

<p><i>b</i>.Hands and feet wholly or mostly white above,very conspicuously 
            contrasted with the arms and legs in the dark phase and always

<p>Miller mentioned as an additional diagnostic character the direction of the hairs on the radial side of the forearm towards the thumb. The two British Indian species differ in this respect.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type ogf hoolock,</i> Garo Hills, Assam; of <i>fuscus</i>, ``the vicinity of the  Himalaya Mountains''; of <i>choromandus,</i> unknown; of <i>scyritus</i>, Assam*.</p>

<p>Distribution.- From ASSAM, CACHAR, and CHITTAGONG through UPPER BURMA to WESTERN YUNNAN and the NORTH SHAN STATES.</p>

<p>Coat long and thick, smooth, not raised into a tuft on the crown of the head, and abundant round the callosities and the genital area. Hairs on the forearm growing upwards from the  wrist to the elbow. Colour varying, sexually dimorphic in the adult; the male is black, with a contrasted silvery-white brow-band and a brown or grey beard-like tuft on the genital area; the female is more variable and much paler, the entire upper side and the outside of the limbs may be tolerably uniformly golden or ruddy-buff, or brownish-buff clouded with brown on the back or buffy-white on the head, nape, fore part of the back, shoulders, and arms, becoming clouded with brown on the flanks lions, and legs; the usually the digits, or at least their distal ends, are black; the face is encircled by white hairs, with a narrow line of white between and below the eyes; the ventral surface, the middle line of the throat, and the cheeks  up to the ears darker or lighter brown, always darker than the dorsal surface, and the brown hue of the cheeks, often very dark, emphasises the pale band round the face; the hairs of the genital region just below the vulva are brown or black, always darker than the surrounding  hairs.</p>

<p>There has been great difference of opinion about the incidence of the black and pale phases in the two sexes. G.M.Allen (Amer.Mus.Novit. no.429, p.5,1930) suggested that the species goes through colour-changes similar to those known to occur in the Indo-Chinese species <i>H.(Nomascus) concolor,</i>  which I described many years ago (Proc.Zoo.Soc. 1905, p.169). This suggestion was  proved correct by McCann (Journ. Bomb. Nat Hist. Soc.xxxvi. p.395, 1933), who, from his observations in the Naga Hills, found that the young at birth is pale greyish-white, with a yellowish tinge, gradually darkens with age, and finally turns black before reaching maturity. This black hue is retained throughout life by the {\male} ; but in the {\female} at puberty the coat fades to the pale yellowish-brown hue. McCann's observations on the colour-change in the {\female}  Hoolock were subsequently confirmed by Major W B. Shakespear (Jour. Bomb. Nat. His. Soc. xxxvii. p. 214, 1934). A specimen which was at first grey gradually changed to jet-black, and stayed that colour until about 51/2 years old,  when she began to turn grey and became greyish all over. The largest black {\female} I have seen had the head and body 20 in. long, the foot 51/2 in., and weighed 8 lb.; but in the skull the milk-canines were still in place and last molar not erupted.</p>

<p>*The types of <i>choromandus</i> and <i>scyritus</i> in the British Museum are females in the pale phase.</p>

<p>Some individual differences in colour may be mentioned. In three adult {\male} {\male} from H'Kamati, Upper Burma, the chin may be pale buffy, matching  the brow-band, and strongly contrasted with the surrounding black or dark brown or uncontrasted. The hairs of the genital tuft, from 50 to 55 mm. long, similarly vary from being black throughout, black at the base, and brown distally or uniformly pale greyish-brown and conspicuous from its generally pale hue. In a {\male} from Hatikhai, in the Cacher Hills, there is no white on the chin and the hairs of the genital tuft, 58 mm. long, are brown distally; in one from the Kabaw Valley, Upper Chindwin, to the west of the river, the chin is also dark, but the genital hairs are very deep blackish-brown and about 45 mm. long.  But in a {\male} from Homalin,Upper Chidwin, on the east bank of the river, there is some white on the chin and the genital hairs, measuring 75 mm., are blackish at the base and largely grey distally, and in one from Gokteik, in the N.Shan States, the chin is brown, the gential hairs, 85 mm. long, are black at the base, brown in the middle, and grey at the tip. The difference in the colour of the genital hairs is probably a question of bleaching from blackish-brown to reddish, and finally to grey. In the {\female} the prevalent colour, as shown by skins from H'Kamti, the Kabaw Valley, and the Chine Hills, is mainly shining buff above, brown below and on the cheeks. One from Margharita, in the Naga Hills, stands out for the very rich orange-ochreous hue of the upper side and outside of the limbs. Very different is a {\female} from Brahapjan, Lakhimpur, which is not so richly coloured as the skin from H'Kamti, being browner on the back and greyer on the shoulders, head, and outside of the limbs.</p>

<p>The flesh-measurements (in English inches) and the weights (in 1b.) of some specimens are as follows:-</p>

<p>Although the sexes overlap in size, the {\male} {\male} from these data are a little larger on the average than the {\female} {\female}.</p>

<p>The skull varies individually in the height and length of the cranial portion, the development of the brow-ridges, which thicken with age, in the size and shape of the orbits and of the anterior narial aperture, and in other particulars. As the following table of measurements shows, {\male} skulls are on the average a little larger than {\female} skulls, and thus bear out the conclusion established by the flesh-measurements of the slight average superiority of the {\male}. The points in which the skull differs from that of <i>H.lar</i>, the other British Indian species, are mentioned under that heading.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Pemberton's record of this Gibbon in Bhutan, rejected by Blanford, and not subsequently confirmed, may perhaps be true, since the Survey secured it in Lakhimpur to the north of the Brahmaputra. In the Mishmi, Naga, Garo, and other hill-ranges on the other side of this river it seems to be plentiful, and west of the Chindwin, in the Kabaw Valley and Chin Hills, it certainly occurs. But how much farther south it goes is a little uncertain. Tickell, it is true, said it occurs in Arakan, but he thought the Gibbon he called the Hoolock from this district was different from the Hoolock of Assam. In the H'Kamti State, Upper Burma, it is equally plentiful on both banks of the Chindwin according to Shortridge, who states that it must have crossed to the eastern side by way of the Hukawang Valley, above the source of the river, but that the comparatively flat country on the east bank, S. of H'Kamti, was unfavourable to its extension farther south. East of the Irrawaddy it is found in the Kakhyen Hills, Western Yennan, and in the Hsipaw and N. Shan States*     </p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---Anderson wrote of this Gibbon as occurring in ``large troops'' in the dense forests on each side of the Irawaddy below Bhamo, where in the early morning the surrounding hills echoed their howling. In the Kakhyen Hills he found that they slept at night in the sheltered warm valleys and at daybreak ascended the hills to a height of about 4,000 ft., traversing the forest with wonderful rapidity, uttering the while their characteristic cry ``<i>Whoko ! Whoko !''</i> Their diet consisted of the ``essential elements of sylvian life'': leaves, flowers, insects, spiders, eggs, and birds. From the eagerness and method with which captive specimens in Calcutta caught and devoured small living birds, Anderson inferred that the Hoolock ``must be a scourge to the feathery tribe.'' Candler, however (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1906, p.187), who observed this Ape in Cachar, differs from Anderson with respect to its diet. He thinks they feed mainly on fruits and the succulent shoots of young bamboos and other trees, and they will certainly eat some spiders. But his captive specimens refused eggs and showed no partiality for insects or small birds, merely pulling them to pieces and possibly tasting them dagged</p>

<p>dagged Anderson's record of it from Pegu was, I suspect, due to his inability to distinguish it in the pale phase from <i>H. lar</i>.</p>

<p>*My own experience with Hoolocks in the London Zoological Gardens bears out Candler's opinion. No doubt, however, they differ individually in tastes.</p>

<p>Nor is Anderson's statement that they occur in large troops borne out by subsequent observers. Mackenzie, who came across them in the heavier jungles of the Chin Hills up to 5,000 ft. and in the Kabaw Valley, states that they usually go about in parties of three or four, but sometimes singly; once only did he notice a party of as many as six, and in the Hsipaw State Shortridge observed them in pairs or singly, although he was told that where plentiful they are gregarious. It is quite possible that their habits in this respect vary locally and that the usual family parties may at times join forces.</p>

<p>McCann (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxvi. p. 395, 1933) has given a tolerably full account of the habits of this Gibbon in the Naga Hills. He confirms the statements of Shortridge and Mackenzie that it goes about in small family parties consisting of the two parents and one or more young, the largest party seen being composed of seven, of which the youngest was a baby. He thinks there is a definite breeding season; and since every mature {\female} shot in January and early March had a young one, he infers that the young are born in the cold weather between November and February. He also believes that maturity is reached in four or five, possibly six, years, that the young adults then leave the party or are driven from it by the parents.</p>

<p>They spend most of the day in high trees, and in the early mornings may often be seen sunning themselves on exposed boughs, but during the hottest part of the day they frequently descend to lower levels of the jungle. When alarmed they hide in the foliage, in the forks of branches or in bamboo clumps, and their usual alarm-call is a sharp, rather harsh bark, often repeated; but alarm is also sometimes expressed by a sound like a loud belch repeated from time to time. When sleeping they typically assume a sitting posture on a branch, with the head buried between the knees.</p>

<p>Their diet consists of leaves, flowers, and fruits, varied with spiders and certain edible insects. Water for drinking is usually taken off the foliage either direct with the tongue or by wetting and licking the hands. In dense forests they seldom come to the ground; but now and again they leave the trees and enter villages to plunder cultivated gardens, being particularly fond of the flowers of <i>Bombax</i>.</p>

<p>Over the ground they move with exceeding rapidity for a short distance in the typical Gibbon fashion described above, but stop from time to time to rest.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula (restricted by Kloss in 1929).</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The Malay Peninsula northwards through TENASSERIM and the adjoining district of Siam into LOWER BURMA.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>H.hoolock</i> by its slightly smaller size,by the hairs on the radial (inner) side of the forearm growing downwards from the elbow to the thumb, upwards from the wrist to the elbow externally, by having the entire hands and feet, or at least the fingers and toes, white and contrasted with the arms and legs, and by the absence of sexual dimorphism in colour between the adult {\male} and {\female}, which may be either blackish or varying shades of brown, tawny buff or even cream; but the black phase is distinguished from that of <i>H hoolock</i> not only by the whiteness of the extremities, but also by a conspicuous white band encircling the face. In the pale phases these white areas are not so conspicuous, although always visible, and the facial band is seldom thrown into relief by the brown cheeks; nor is the lower side noticeably darker and browner than the upper, as in the adult {\female} of <i>H hoolock</i>. The rump, with its callosities, is not so concealed by hair, and the genital tuft of the adult {\male} is much smaller than in <i>H. hoolock*</i>. The skull is a little smaller, but has relatively wider orbits. with the brow-ridges better developed at their inner ends, the upper jaw is weaker and the teeth a little smaller (fig. 7, p. 22).</p>

<p>LOcality of the <i>type</i>, Malay Peninsula about lat. 12 &#xB0; N.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Northern part of the Malay Peninsula, TENASSERIM, S.W Siam. </p>

<p>*This description of the external features applies to the typical <i>H. lar lar</i> from Southern Malaya and to its northern representative in Lower Burma, but not to <i>H. lar pileatus</i> of Siam and Cambodia, which intergrades with the Burmese form.</p>

<p>Distinguished, at least on the average, from typical <i>lar</i> from the southern part of the Malay Peninsula by having the hands and feet less extensively white by encroachment of the black of the arms and legs below the wrist and ankle and by being blacker and less brown on the body in the dark phase. In the pale phase the tops of the hands and feet look soiled.</p>

<p>Geoffroy's type was an adult {\female} in the pale phase. His coloured plate, if accurate in this respect, shows that the feet at least were wholly white above up to the ankle-joint. The locality of this Gibbon is about the same latitude as Tenasserium Town, considerably to the north of Bankachon; and in 1927 in my paper dealing with this species of Gibbon special attention was drawn to two {\male} specimens from the last-named locality,close to Victoria Point, Tenasserim, on account of the blackness of the wrists and ankles and the infuscation of the upper sides of the hands and feet, serving to link in this respect typical <i>lar</i> with the race <i>H. lar pileatus</i> which inhabits Siam and Cambodia. On revising his abundant material of the species two years later Kloss found that this coloration of the hands and feet accompanied by the general blacker hue of the back, served to distinguish racially Tenasserim specimens from those found farther south, and he adopted <i>entelloides</i> to designate them.</p>

<p>In a series of skins from Bankachon, Victoria Point, Tenasserim (Hume and Shortridge), the darkening of the hands and feet is very variable. In a rufous-brown {\male} the hairs on the fingers and toes and some on the top of the hands and feet are brown. In others the hands and feet may be dusky, greyish-brown above to the base of the fingers and toes. Even in those with the whitest hands and feet the dark hue of the arms and legs extends practically down to the naked skin of the palm and sole behind and to a corresponding distance in front. But in a {\female} skin from Tavoy (Smith) the hands and feet are as white as in typical <i>lar</i>, the black of the limbs stopping short about an inch above the naked skin of the palm and sole behind and to a corresponding distance in front. In its general hue, however, this specimen is not so brown as in typical <i>lar</i>, the back being black and extensively grey on the shoulders.</p>

<p>From available material it appears the percentage of skins in the black phase is less in Southern than in Northern Tenasserim. Thus in 22 skins from Bankachon, 4 {\male} {\male} are black, 11 {\male} {\male} and 7 {\female} {\female} are pale. On the other hand 1 {\female} from Tavoy is black; in 4 from the Taok Plateau (Vernay), 1 {\male} and 2 {\female} {\female} are black, 1 {\female} pale; in 2 {\male} {\male} from 17 miles east of Lakya (Vernay) one is black, the other pale, and 1 {\male} from the Haungtharaw River, Kawkareik (Davison), is pale. Of the 8 skins from these localites, 5 are black and 3 pale, 2 {\male} {\male} being black, 2 pale, and 3 {\female} {\female} black and 1 pale. In Amherst, however, Tickell says pale specimens were more numerous than black.</p> 

<p>The only newly-born young I have seen was collected by Shortridge at Bankachon. It is darkish brown in colour, paler than the normal dark phase, and darker than the pale phase of the adults. A rather older black young one from Amherst was figured by Tickell; and two half-grown specimens from Bankachon are in the normal pale phase.</p>

<p>THe extremes in size and weight are supplied by the long series of skins from Bankachon. The largest and smallest {\male} and {\female} are entered below, with the average length of the head and body.

<p>The subjoined table of skull-measurements shows that although the tatal and mandibular lengths of the largest may equal those of the smallest skull of <i>H. hoolock</i>, the averages are decidedly less. On the other hand the lenghts of the condylobase and of the upper cheek-teeth are in all cases less. Also it seems evident that the skulls of <i>H. lar</i>, both {\male} and {\female}, are individually much more variable than of <i>H. hoolock</i> despite the comparatively restricted geographical range of <i>H. lar entelloides</i>.</p>

<p>THe young are born in the early part of the cold weather, as in the case of the Hoolock, and are dependent on the mother for seven months.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---This Gibbon, Tickell tells us, is found in great ab_ n_ dance in all the forests skirting the hills of Tenasserim, but not above 3,500 ft. It habitually lives in troops of from eight or ten to twenty individuals of all ages and both sexes. Only occasionally is an old male seen by itself. In indulging in early morning concerts in the tree-tops, one troop calling to another in a distant part of the forest, and in remaining silent, feeding and resting, during the greater part of the day afterwards, also in its instinct to hide in the foliage or behind a thick  branch when danger threatens, it resembles the Hoolock; but according to Tickell it is much less active on the ground than species and can only shuffle along on its legs in a half-erect posture, using its arms for support*.</p>

<p>According to Shortridge this Gibbon is plentiful near Victoria Point, where, although not avoiding the neighbourhood of human habitations, it seldom leaves the forests and is probably rarely destructive to ground crops. It is particularly noisy in the early morning and evening, the call consisting of a series of rapid whoops ascending and descending through several octaves, the sound, although somewhat resembling that of a siren, being one of the most musical and striking to be heard in tropicaal jungles. He confirms Tickell's statement that the ape is nearly always found in parties of about a dozon, although several parties may sometimes mingle temporaily.</p>

<p>Fig. 8.---Lar Gibbon (<i>Hylobates lar entelloides</i>), black and pale phase showing method of climbing by brachiation.</p>

<p>*This statement must be taken with reservation. I have seen Lar Gibbons in the Zoological Gardens that ran and walked erect with uplifted arms, and differed not at all from Hoolocks in those respects.</p>

<p>From observtions on captive specimens of this Gibbon in Rangoon Sir S.M. Robinson discovered that the period of gestation is seven months as in ordinary Monkeys, not nine months as in the Chimpanzee. At birth the young one had very little hair on the head and a wizened, old-looking face; but in a short time the hair grew and skin of the face filled out. It clung to the hair of the mother, who held it in place with her arm, thigh or foot. In another case, recoreded by Mr.Ogilvie, the {\male} stayed with the {\female} after the birth of the young one, which was carried by the {\female} until it was over two years old. During that time it was never seen to take any food but its mother's milk.</p>

<p>Section <i>CYNOMORPHA</i>.</p>

<p>To this group of Catarhine Primates belong the Monkeys of Africa and Asia. The tail, in British Indian species, is generally long or longish, but may be reduced to a stump 1 in. or less in length. The arms and legs are subequal in length, the hands are much shorter than the feet and have the thumb weak, tied closely to the palm and emerging from the middle of its inner edge; the heel of the foot is narrower in proportion to its length, and the pads of the palms and soles are comparatively well defined.</p>

<p>As in the Apes, or ANTHROPOMORPHA, these structural features are correlated with the habitual method of progression both in trees and on the ground. In running or walking the attitude is essentially quadrupedal. The fore and hind quarters are nearly on a level, and part or the whole of the palm of the hand is applied to the ground, but the heel of the foot is raised The erect bipedal attitude can be assumed for the purpose of looking around, but walking on the legs is difficult and only occasionally resorted to. In climbing, rapid progression through the trees is effected by a series of leaps, the propelling power lying in the strong, springy hind quarters and legs.</p>

<p>It is on account of their resemblance to typical quadrupedal mammals in their attitude and way of moving on the ground that these monkeys are called CYNOMORPHA or Dog-like; and in their method of climbing they do not differ essentially from ordinary arboreal mammals. They are clearly less highly organized than the Apes; but are much more varied in their habits, some being essentially forest dwellers, whereas others live mainly on the ground, often on rocky hill-sides.</p>

<p>The CYNOMORPHA are divisible into the following two families, both of which are represented in the British Indian fauna:-</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Cheek-pouches present, the stomach simple       <p>[p. 32.</p>
and undivided.        .. .</p>                   <p>Cercopithecid{\ae},</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Cheek-pouches absent, the stomach complex
and sacculated</p>                               <p>Colobid{\ae}, p.83.</p>

<p>Family CERCOPITHECID{\AE}.</p>

<p>To this family belong the Baboons (<i>Papio</i>) the Mangabeys (<i>Cercocebus</i>), the Cercopitheques or Guenons (<i>Cer-copithecus</i>) and other genera restricted to Africa, and the Macaques (<i>Macaca</i>), which are mainly  found only in southern and eastern Asia, with one isolated species in Morocco, whence it has been introduced to Gibraltar. The British Indian species in this volume are, for the sake of convenience, all assigned to <i>Macaca</i>; but they fall into several natural groups for which generic or subgeneric names have been proposed and are sometimes adopted The characters on which these are based are mainly the structure of the genital organs in the male, the length of the tail, the direction of hair-growth on the head, and a few other features of less importance.</p>

<p>As in most Monkeys, the external characters supply a much better basis for the determination of the species than the skulls, which are individually very variable, and intergrade in some cases in a remarkable way.</p>

<p>Genus <b>MACACA</b> Lac\'ep\`ede.</p>

<p> <i>Macaca</i>, Lac\'ep\`ede, Tabl. Mamm. p. 4, 1799(reprinted M\'em. Inst. Nat. Sci. iii, p. 490).</p>

<p> <i>Macacus</i>, of most subsequent authors.</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>Simia inuus</i> Linn.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i> Apart from the typical species, isolated and indigenous in Morocco and Algeria, restricted to south-eastern Asia roughly from Kafiristan to Pekin, omitting the Tibetan Plateau, and thence to Borneo and the Philippines.</p>

<p>In all its external features this genus is very variable. Its nearest ally appears to be the African genus <i>Cercocebus</i>, the Mangabey. From this it may be distinguished by the absence in the skull of the deep pit on the side of the muzzle just below the orbit.</p>

<p>In many species of Macaques the hair on the crown radiates from a central whorl and is differentiated by its direction, sometimes by its length, from the hairs on the sides of the crown and behind the brows to form a definite ``cap.'' In British Indian species this arrangement occurs in <i>M silenus, M. nemestrina, M speciosa, M radiata, and M. sinica</i>, the ``cap'' reaching its maximum of development in the last two, which take their trivial names, ``Bonnet'' and ``Toque'' Macaques, from that feature. The arrangement is also found in, perhaps, about 25 percent. of skins of <i>M. assamensis</i>. But in <i>M. mulatta</i> and <i>M. irus</i> the hair slopes backwards from the brow without a parting or whorl, and the ``cap'' is similarly absent in the S. Chinese <i>M. cyclopis</i>, the Japanese <i>M. fuscata</i>, and the ``Gibraltar Ape,'' <i>M.sylvana</i>. Probably the ``cap'' is a later development in evolution than the straight-haired arrangement.</p>

<p> <i>Key to the Identification of the Species of</i> Macaca.</p>

<p>In this key the species are not arranged altogether in accordance with their affinities. The natural groups into which they fall and the names that have been given to them are as follows:-</p>

<p> <i>Silenus</i>, Goldfuss, 1820; type, <i>silenus</i>. Here also, apparently, belongs <i>nemestrinus</i>, which has several characters in common with <i>  			        silenus</i>, despite the differences set forth in the key.</p>

<p> <i>Lessodes</i>,Gistel, 1848; type, specious.This is an isolated species, distinguished mainly by the abnormal external genital organs of the {\male}.</p>

<p> <i>Rhesus</i>, Lesson, 1840; type, <i>mulatta</i>. <i>M assamensis</i> may also be provisionally referred here.</p>

<p> <i>Cynomolgus</i>,Reichenbach, 1862; type, <i>irus</i>. This species also stands alone, the length of the tail, in which it resembles the others 	   	entered under <i>\'e</i>, being merely a primitive character.</p>

<p> <i>Zati</i>, Reichenbach, 1862; type, <i>radiata</i>; also contains <i>sinica</i>. These two are nearly alike in the mode of hair-growth on the head, and differ from the rest in the peculiar structure of the {\male} genitalia.</p>

<p>The type-species of <i>Macaca</i>, an earlier name than any of the others, is apparently most nearly related to <i>Rhesus</i>, but differs in its tail. which is generally wholly suppressed and is at most just detectable.</p>

<p>The smallest of the British Indian species of <i>Macaca</i>, with the tail subcylindrical, smooth-haired, and long, longer than the head and body; the hairs on the crown long, radiating from a central whorl, those in front of the whorl forming a definite fringe, with their tips nearly reaching the black eyebrows; the hairs on the cheek short, not forming bushy whiskers, those on the temples and close to the face directed backwards and meeting the upward and forward stream in front of the ear to form a distinct whorl on the cheek. The penis large, with a long, swollen glans which has a well-developed ``corna.'' No periodic catamenial swelling affecting the tissues round the gential orfice in the {\female}.</p>

<p>* The confused synonymy of this species and of its near ally <i>M. radiata</i> of Southern India was cleared up in 1921 by Hinton and Wroughton, who showed that the ``Bonnet chinois'' of Buffon, upon which <i>Simia sinica</i> Linn. was based, was the reddish Ceylonese Bonnet Macaque, and not the Indian form as described by Anderson and Blanford. Also that the description of <i>pileatus</i> given by Kerr (Anim. Kingd. p.69, 1792), an author ignored by Blanford as not being ``binomial,'' most emphatically does not apply to any Macaque, nor indeed, to any monkey as yet identified. The same is true of <i>pileata</i> Shaw (Gen. Zool. i, p. 53, 1800), to whom Blanford assigned the name. In this monkey the hair on the crown forms an upstanding rounded tuft, the limbs are black, and the body brown. Hinton and Wrughton's conclusions were confirmed by Miller (Anat. of Rhesus, p. 4, 1933).</p>

<p>General colour above variable, sometimes brownish or olivaceous, with paler buffy speakling, but usually more or less ochreous or reddish, sometimes bright and ferruginous the limb externally typically paler than the back, but the upper thigh brighter, the tail above darker, with a blackish thinge; the underside, inner side of the limbs, sides of the neck, and cheek white or whitish, sometimes with a pale area passing over the ear from the temple. Hairs on the crown very variable, sometimes directed forwards as far as the brows, but sometimes there is a shortish area behind the brows, with the short hairs directed sideways or backwards.</p>

<p>Fig. 9.---Upper and side views of head of Toque Macaque (<i>Macaca sinica</i>) to show typical hair-growth on the crown and cheek. (Drawn from skin of the type of <i>inaurea</i> from Cheddikulam.)</p>          

<p>The skull of <i>M sinica</i> is small for genus,and in the adult {\male} rather low for its length, due to the produced jaws; the brow is prominent owing to a pronounced depression behind it; the temporal ridges are moderately well developed, sometimes meeting in the middle line; the occipital crest is moderately salient, and there is a distinct constriction of the muzzle caused by a depression behind the canines and below the orbit*. </p>

<p>*Phillips published an excellent photogravure of the skull of an adult {\male} of this species, said to be &#x2154; nat. size. It is, however, reduced by considerably more than &#x2153;. I have no material sufficing to show if there is any cranial difference between the two races of <i>M. sinica</i>. Probably there is not.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---``The low-country dry zone'' from the extreme north to the extreme south of CEYLON (Phillips).</p>

<p>The ``bonnet'' uniformly coloured throughout, the hairs drabby-greyish, with paler buffy tips. The general colour is individually and seasonally very variable; usually in the fresh coat the hairs of the upper side are dark greyish or blackish for about two-thirds of their length, with the ochrous or reddish. the shoulders and outside of the thighs being brighter than the back, but the tips may be dull buffish, so that there is no bright tint in the pelage except a little on the outer side of the thigh, sometime the dorsal tint is more uniformly brown without bright speckling. This may be due to the breaking off of the pale tips of the hairs when dead before the moult. Skins, for instance, from Maha Oya, E.P. (Aug. 12 and 17), have the coat on the back short, coarse, and dark olive-brown in hue, quite unlike normal fresh-coated skins from the Eastern Province; but beneath the old brown hairs the newly erupting coat shows the characteristic rich ochreous speckling. The hairs of the frontal fringe vary from about 45 to nearly 70 mm., and of the shoulders from about 45 to 55 mm. </p>

<p>*I here accept Phillip's decision to the effect that dull and bright tinted specimens in fresh coat occur indiscriminately throughout the dry zone, although the material at my disposal suggested that bright reddish specimens are dominant at Mankeni and Maha Oya in the E.P., and at Wellawaya and Tellulah in Uva, and duller, olivaceous specimens in the N.P., the two meeting at Kala Oya in N.W.P. This opinion was expressed by the racial name <i>inaurea</i> given to adult {\male} in perfect coat (Nov.) collected at Cheddikulam, north of Adam's Bridge, N.P. On the label of this skin, which closely resembles some skins of the Indian average species, <i>M. radiata</i>, except that there is a little red on the outside of the thigh, the collector, E.W. Mayor, who two months earlier had secured a fair number of skins in the E.P., wrote: ``Fur seems darker here,'' <i>i, e</i>., at Cheddikulam, where he saw living specimens.   </p>

<p>The weight of the larger {\male} from Mankeni was 12 1b., of the smaller 10 1b., the one from Cheddikulam being 10&#xBD; 1b., the same as phillips's average of 4 {\male} {\male}; phillips's largest {\female} was 9&#xBD; 1b. and his average of 2 {\female} {\female} 7&#xBD; 1b.</p>

<p>This Toque Macaque is found in the jungles of the low country dry zone about as far south, according to Phillips, as lat. 8&#xB0; N. in the west and central portion of the island and on the eastern side to the extreme south. Major E. W Mayor, who collected many specimens both in the northern and eastern parts of its range, found them shy and very difficult to shoot Phillips reports that troops composed solely of young individuals have been observed on several occasions. The rest of its habits are no doubt the same as in the next better-known race.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, Rayigam Korale, Western Province.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.--``The low-country wet zone and the central hill-zone'' of CEYLON (Phillips).</p>

<p>Distinguishing from typical <i>sinica</i> by the colour of the ``bonnet,'' of which the hairs of the anterior part or fringe are uniformly reddish or buffy throughout and those of the posterior half dusky greyish at the base, reddish at the tips The general colour of the upper side is also rather brighter red on the average, and a darker appearance is imparted to the pelage by the partial exposure of the deeper black base of the hairs owing to the looseness of the rather longer coat.</p>

<p>The type of this race is an unusually richly red specimen with the hairs of the frontal fringe 75 mm. and of the shoulder 58 mm. In another the same measurements are 72 and 60 mm.</p>

<p>The following measurements (in English inches) and weights (1b.) are taken from Phillips's volume:-</p>

                                                        <p>Head and

<p>The average weight of 2 {\male} {\male} was 9&#xBE; 1b., of 2 {\female} {\female} 7&#xBD; 1b. These particulars suggest that this race may be a trifle smaller on the average than typical <i>sinica</i>; but the data are insufficient and there are not enough adult skulls available to throw light on the point. (For skull-measurements of <i>M sinica see p. 43</i>.)</p> 

<p>According to Phillips this race of the Toque Macaque is found from the highest mountain peaks to the seashore, and on the lower hill-slopes of the northern and eastern portions of its area it everywhere blends with the typical dry-zone lowland race. It occurs both in the forests and in the ``sholas'' or isolated patches of jungle in the grass-covered hills. Like other Macaques it is gregarious, its troops consisting of about twenty or more individuals of both sexes and of all ages. It is mostly active by day, moving about and feeding both in trees and on the ground, its diet consisting of fruits, berries, flowers, seeds, and shoots as well as of insects, grubs, and spiders. Often also it raids plantations of coco-nut and cardamom, committing considerable damage. In districts where it is persecuted on this account it is wary of man, but otherwise pays little heed to him. It has, however a great dread of leopards, pythons, and crocodiles, the latter especially when it approaches water to drink. Sometimes, however, it takes to the water to hide and is a good swimmer, both at the surface and below it. Like the Wanderoos (Leaf-Monkey), with which it occasionally associates, it has the habit of hiding in the foliage when frightened.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> unknown; apparently a menagerie specimen, according to Miller.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---SOUTHERN INDIA, at least as far north on the west as Satara, and on the east not north of the Godavari River.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>M. sinica</i> by its larger size,as shown by the flesh and cranial measurements, by the hair-growth of the top and sides of the head, and by the generally duller colour.</p>

<p>*For the synonymy of this species see above under <i>M. sinica</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the hair on the crown is typically fundamentally the same as in <i>M. sinica</i>. It always radiates from a central whorl and is long posteriorly and laterally, but anteriorly it is always shorter, so that the fringe overlaps a smaller area of the forehead, and the bonnet, instead of being Circular is subelliptical. Usually the tips of the hairs of the fringe extend about half-way between the whorl and the eyebrows, and the short hairs behind the brows extend sideways from a median parting*, but the arrangement is very variable. Sometimes there is a whorl far back on the forehead, whence the short hairs radiate at the hinder end of the medium parting sometimes the hairs of the centre of the fringe in front are only a few mm. long, and the lateral hairs extend like a tuft on each side; sometimes the hairs behind the brows are directed backwards, unparted and long, those in the centre overlapping the whorl on the crown and the mesially abbreviated fringe in front of it. The short hairs on the cheek grow upwards from the throat and lower jaw to the level of the ear or thereabouts without forming the whorl described in <i>M. sinica</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 10.---Upper and side views of head of Bonnet Macaque (<i>Macaca radiata</i>) to show typical hair-growth on the crown and cheeks. (Drawn from skin from South Coorg.)</p>

<p>The coat and colour are variable seasonally and individually independently of the season. Typically the winter coat is deep brown or olive-brown above, with little, if any, pale speckling, and the hairs of the bonnet are dark distally, paler at the base, the arms are greyer than the back, the legs greyer than the arms, the tail is blackish above in its basal half, brown distally, and the underside is whitish-grey; but in spring and early summer the long hairs of the upper side, up to about 70 mm. on the shoulders, fade to a buffy-grey tint, and become dull, lustreless, shaggy, and harsh to the touch. Occasionally , however, there is a distinct yellowish speckling in the dorsal pelage recalling that of <i>M. sinica</i>, and in one skin there is a reddish tinge in the hairs of the flanks, shoulders, and sides of the neck. Some skins are very like the skin of <i>M.sinica</i> from Cheddikulam, except that they never have the brighter hue on the outside of the thigh*. </p>

<p>* Described by Hinton and Wroughton and illustrated by Hill, The hairs of the middle of the fringe vary, however, from about 25 to 60 mm.</p>

<p>The skull of <i>N. radiata</i> is larger than that of <i>M. sinica</i>, and has the brows less prominent owing to a shallower depression behind them; and this is associated with relatively  narrower width across the orbits, with on the average at least weaker temporal ridges and a shallower depression on the muzzle behind the canines and below the orbits. These features indicate less muscular development.</p>

<p>*Osmaan Hill, who compared living and injected examples of <i>M.sinica</i> and <i>M. radiata</i>, says that <i>M. radiata</i> diffres in having the face muddy-flesh tinted, with soft hairs,the edges of the lips and the entire ears  unpigmented, and the ears more prominent, whereas in <i>M.sinica</i> the face is pale flesh, with bristly hairs, the edges of the lips and the ears pigmented, and the ears less prominent. His figures however, contradict the statement regarding the prominence of the ears, and in dried skins of <i>radiata</i> the ears may be pallid or dark greyis-black. As aa further difference he says that <i>M.sinica</i> has a well-marked tract of white hairs passing over the ears from the upper cheek to the side of the neck, the same tract in <i>M. radiata</i>being dark. This tract is very variable in distinctness in made-up skins of <i>M.sinica</i>, and in a skin of <i>M. radiata</i> from Mysore there is a distinct pale tract of light hairs on the area in question. In the texture of the hairs of the face I can find no constant difference.</p>  

<p>The tail is very variable. It may be as much as about 5 in. lomger than the head and body or 1 in shorter. The weights of the adult {\male} range from 13 1b. (N. Coorg) to 19&#xBD; 1b. (Bellary); of adult {\female} from 7 to 8 1b.</p>

<p>A few isolated specimens, <i>e. g</i>., one from sea-level below the Gersoppa Falls in Kanara and anther from Cumbum in Madura, which are aberrant un colour, suggest the possibility of the inclusion of more than one race in typical <i>radiata</i> as above defined. Setting these aside, this Macaque occurs in Western India in Satara, Dharwar, 2,300ft.; Kanara, 2000, ft.; Mysore, Coorg, 2,000 to 3,555 ft.; the Nilgiri Hills, 5,120 ft.; Cochin, 1,500 ft.; the Palni Hills, 3,000 to 5,500 ft.; and in the Eastern Ghats at Salem, the Shevaroy Hills, 4,500 ft., and Kurnool. It is even found ``in populous towns, where it pillages the shops of fruit and grain.'' In Cochin, at least, it is commoner, according to  R.O' Brien, in the plains than in the hills Shortridge reports that in Dharwar it is very plentiful, going about in large parties of from 20 to 30 individuals. On the banks of a stream he saw troops of them mixing apparently on perfectly friendly terms with Langurs, but when alarmed the two species separated. Near the Hindu temples at Gaday, where it is protected, large numbers are said to have died of bubonic plague. At Vijayanagar in Bellary it is plentiful in the vicinity of Hampi Temple, and it is sufficiently plentiful throughout Coorg to be a great nuisance to the owners of coffee estates by destroying large quantities of ripe berries. Its habits no doubt are the same everywhere, and similar to those of <i>M. sinica</i>. In the Nelliampathy Hills, according to Kinloch, it occurs in modarate troops on the northern cliffs and in the bamboo jungles on the south slopes, but not in the evergreen forest of the plateau.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, Boothapaundy, on the Ghats north of Aramboly in Travancore.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---TRAVANCORE.</p>

<p>Distinguished from typical <i>radiata</i> by its colour, which, although very variable, is paler, the fore part of the bonnet tending to ochraceous, and the same colour often present on the shoulders, lower back, buttocks, and thighs, the underside varying from dirty white to buff.</p>

<p>This description is taken from the account given by Hill, who saw many living specimens. I described the race on the evidence of two skins, and distinguished it by its much paler winter coat, buffy throughout above, the underside being cream, with the skin pallid, not blackish. The flesh-measurement of the larger of the two specimens collected by R. S. Pillay are:-</p>

                                                             body.</p>

<p>These dimensions suggest a smaller race than typical <i>radiata</i>; but the skull of the smaller specimen, the type, is as large as {\female} skulls of <i>radiata</i>.</p>

<p>Blanford referred to a specimen from Travancore with ``unusually long top-knot.'' In the type of <i>diluta</i> the hairs of the forehead are long, and sweep backwards from the brow front hairs of the bonnet a kind of upstanding crest just in front of the whorl on the crown. Presumably this feature is inconstant, since Hill does not refer to it.</p>

<p>According to Hill this Macaque is quite common in Travancore and is distributed throughout the district. He came across two troops associated with Hindu temples, one a few miles south of Alleppy, on the road to Quilon, the other five miles south of Aramboly.</p>

<p>Although the {\male} skulls of <i>radiata</i> intergrade in size with those of <i>sinica</i>, the general superiority of the skulls of both sexes of <i>radiata</i> is shown by the following averages:-</p>

<p> <b>5. Macaca mulatta</b> (<i>Zimmermann</i>). The Rhesus Macaque.</p>

<p> (<i>For synonymy and bibliographical references see under the subspecific headings.</i>)</p>

<p>A medium-sized or tolerably large Macaque, with the tail uniformly hairy throughout typically pendulous, not carried in an arch above the level of the buttocks, tolerably short, usually about half the length of the head and body, typically considerably longer than the hind foot, but in some Chinese races hardly exceeding it. Hair of the crown directed backwards from the brows, without a whorl or parting, and not forming a definite crest or ``cap''; no definite crest on the cheeks or temples, but usually a whorl low down on the cheek. Colour very characteristic, the head, shoulders, arms, and fore back generally <i>olivaceous</i> in hue owing to the hairs being blackish or grey, but speckled with duller or brighter buff annulations; but the loins, rump, and the base of the tail are orange-red in varying intensities; the base of the hairs is grey or whitish, not annulated. The skin of the face, hands and feet is pallied, although the face is sometimes suffused with red. The penis is tolerably large with the glans elongated, about twice as long as its posterior width, expanded distally, with the left lip of the orifice much larger than the right and the orifice terminal. There is no noticeable catamenial swelling in the female, but the skin of the rump is often bright red.</p>

<p>The skull of <i>M Mulatta*</i> is much more variable in size and shape than the skull of <i>M. radiata</i>, and has the sagittal crest and the temporal ridges typically less well developed, and there is scarcely a trace of constriction behind the canines on the muzzle. But in skulls of <i>M Mulatta</i> has the zygomatic and transorbital widths a little greater, giving a more robust aspect to the skull. The facial profile may be about the same as in <i>M. radiata</i>, the interorbital septum and the nasals forming a relatively shallow, evenly curved concavity; but in some skulls the septum is more steeply and the nasals less steeply sloped, so that the concavity is deeper, giving a ``snub-nosed'' aspect to the face.

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---From Kafiristan and Chitral through the HIMALAYAS and NORTHERN INDIA eastwards to BURMA, Siam, Indo-China, and Hainan and northwards through China to latitude of Pekin.</p>

<p> Three races are found in British Indian territory. In addition to these <i>M. m. lasiotus</i> Gray inhabits Szechwan, <i>M. m. sancti-iohannis</i> Swinhoe (<i>&#x207C; littoralis</i> Elliot) occurs in the neighbourhood of Hong-kong, and <i>M. m tcheliensis</i> M-Edwards near Pekin.</p>

<p>* As pointed out by Hinton and Wroughton, the drawing published by Blanford, (p.12) to illustrate the skull of <i>M. rhesus (&#x207C;mulatta)</i> were taken from a skull of <i>M. assmensis</i>. Anderson put Blanford wrong.</p>

<p>Since the three British Indian races merely differ slightly in size, thickness of coat, and some cranial features from each other, it is needless to epitomize their distinctive characters in an analytical key.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The whole of NORTHERN INDIA from NEPAL, BHUTAN, N. KAMRUP, and ASSAM as far south at least as the Tapti River in the west and not south of the Godavari in the east; also the whole of BURMA from H'Kamti and Homalin in Upper Burma to the south of Prome. Evidence for the occurrence of this race in Siam is supplied by a specimen described as <i>M. siamica</i> by Kolss; in Indo-China by specimens collected by Delacour and Lowe in Annom and Tong-king and in Hainan by specimens which Elliot described as <i>Pithecus brevicaudus</i>.</p>

<p>The  smallest of the three British Indian races of <i>M. mulatta</i>, both in size of the body and the skull, which has on the average a weaker muzzle and less pronounced brow-ridge and the temporal ridges farther apart. The winter coat is also less woolly and shorter, from 2 to 2&#xBD; in. on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Fig. 12.---Skull of subadult {\male} Rhesus Macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta mulatta</i>) from Bhutan Duars.</p>

<p>The colour in the fresh, unfaded coat is very variable individually, irrespective of age, sex, locality, and season, in accordance with the brightness and extent of the paler and darker annulations and the depth of hue of the bases of the hairs of the head and fore quarters, and the duller or more brilliant orange of the hind quarters. The variation is well illustrated by two adult {\male} examples collected on 21 November and 25 November at Rajapara, S. Kamrup, 600 ft. In one the head, nape, and sho\'ulders are yellowish-olive, the annulations of the hairs being clear yellowish-buff, with the bases ashy-grey; the back is brighter and yellower, turning to orange on the loins, and nearly fiery red on the outside of the thighs, the basal portion of the hairs on the red areas being white, the distal portion red and not annulated. The tail is like the rump at the base, greyish-olive terminally. The arms are grey, with yellowish-buff speckling; legs washed with bright yellow, paling from the thigh to the foot, which is greyish-yellow. Underside mostly white, slightly red on the belly. The other is much darker, the head, nape and shoulders being deep greyish-olive, the annulations of the hairs being pallid, greyish-buff, with the bases deeper smoky grey; the back is a more yellowish-olive, with the lumbar region like the head and nape of the first specimen; the buttocks and outside of the thighs are not nearly so fiery or so extensively red in hue. The tail is much darker; the arms also are darker, with grey speckling and blacker hands.  </p>

<p>Occasionally the colour of the fresh coat is rich rusty red all over the dorsal surface, although brighter on the rump. One red specimen of this type was secured at Dangs in Surat together with examples more normally tinted. Another, even redder, came from Baska Nadi, N. Kamrup, 2,000 ft., collected on 5 January. This specimen differs strikingly from the two from S. Kamrup recorded above.</p>

<p>The colour, as well as the length and texture of the coat, also varies greatly in accordance with the season. In the winter, from about November to January, the coat is perfect in colour and soft in texture, the tips of the long hairs tolerably smoothly overlapping, so as to conceal the grey basal portions. Through March, April, May, and June the coat gradually loses its, softness, and colour, the hairs, owing to bleaching,  tend to become more uniformly tinted, buffish- or brownish-grey, and to adhere loosely, in long tufts or patches, displaying the grey hue of their basal portions. The coat is then shaggy and streaky, and decidedly harsh to the touch, the terminal portion of the hairs subsequently breaking off, seemingly from brittleness. Before this dead coat is shed the new coat begins to erupt beneath ir; and in May or June as a rule, the old coat begins to be shed, clearing first on the crown, the hands and feet, and the tail, the tail, when its long hairs have dropped, closely resembling that of the Pig-tailed Macaque (<i>M. nemestrina</i> Linn.). Even as late as July, or even August, remnants of the old, dead, uniformly greyish coat may be found on parts of the body. Similar variations in the colour independent of the season and in accordance with the seasonal condition of the coat, occur also in the other two British Indian local races of this species..</p>

<p>The moult is not exactly coincident in time, even in the same locality, and no doubt varies still more with altitude and latitude in accordance with the onset of warm weather.</p>

<p>About the special habits of this race of <i>mulatta</i> there is little to report. Blanford described it as the common monkey of Northern India as far south as the Godavari. Although not regarded as sacred by the Hindus, it is left unmolested by them. This no doubt explains its fearlessness of man, which he repors, and its occasional occurence in native villages. Otherwise it is most usually seen near cultivated grounds, especially by tanks. In the wilds, he adds, it is commoner amongest trees by streams than in forest jungle. Crump, on the other hand, stated that at Singbhum in Bengal it was very shy and difficult to approach owing to the thick undergrowth it frequented. Aparently its habits vary locally. In Burma Shortridge found it fairly plentiful at Hsipaw in the North Shan States, often near padddy-fields and other cultivatved tracts where small parties of it were observed But here, too, it was shy of man, possibly because it is sometimes eaten by the Burmese, as recored by Mackenzie, who stated that 20 miles south-west of Kindat it was common, especially near cultivation, although big herds of it lived in the jungle.</p>

<p>The weight of the three {\male} specimens from Kumaun and Naini Tal, in order, were 23, 23, and 17&#xBD; 1b. respectively, and of the two {\female} specimens 14&#xBD; and 13 lb.</p>

<p>Although the {\male} from Murree is little larger than the {\male} examples of typical <i>mulatta</i>, the {\male} and {\female} specimens from Kangra and Kumaun are about the same size as in the typical race; but the weights are greater, suggesting more sturdily built monkeys.The dimensions given by True of two {\male} specimens from the type-locality, Lolab in Kashmir, as head and body and tail 23&#xBD;&#x208A;9&#xBD; and 22&#x208A;11 respectively, agree closely with those of the {\male} specimens from Kangra and Kumaun.</p>

<p>True records that the original examples of this Rhesus frequented the pine-forests at Lolab at an altitude of 7,500 ft. The example from Patriata Murree, in the Upper Punjab, was shot at 7,150 ft. At Dharmsala, 4,500 ft., and in Kangra from 2,450 to 5,000 ft., according to Wells, fairly common, frequenting rocky hill-sides and cliffs bordering streams, but is very difficult to catch owing to its shyness of man from being driven away by the owners of the cultivated fields and gardens habitually raids. In Kumaun, where it occurs at altitudes ranging from 3,700 to 1,100 ft., it is more abundant, Crump tells us, than the Langurs (<i>S. entellus schi-staceus</i> or <i>hector</i>) in the outer ranges of the hills, where, during cold weather, it is found in large numbers up to 4,000ft. It sometimes associates with the Langurs by day; but the two species separate at nightfall when retiring to rest.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> Kootai in Lower Chitral, between the Bashgal Valley in Kafiristan and Chitral Valley, 3,600 ft.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Kafiristan and CHITRAL.</p>

<p>The largest of the British Indian races of <i>M. mulatta</i> and, on the available evidence, differing also from <i>villosa</i> by its longer coat, rather duller colour, and bigger skull, which has the brow-ridges higher and more prominent.</p>

<p>Only two specimens of this Macaque have been described in detail. The type, killed at the beginning of February, before the long, loose coat had reached its full length, has the hairs n the shoulder about 100 mm. (4 in.) In the general darkness of the hue of the fresh coat the skin differs strikingly from skins of typical <i>mulatta</i> at the same time of the year, but closely resembles that of the skin <i>villosa</i> from Murree, shot in the middle of June, with the winter coat deteriorated and in process of moulting. The skull, although larger than the largest skull of <i>villosa</i>, is not quite fully developed. The other specimen, a {\female} from Chitral, presented by Sir H. McMahon to the Zoological Gardens, where it died in January, has the coat shorter, only about 60 mm. on the shoulder, but full and longish everywhere. The colour is a little brighter than in the {\male}, but is, on the average, more dusky olive on the fore quarters than in <i>villosa</i>.</p>

<p>Although Capt. Raverty may possibly have been the first to record the occurrence of this Macaque in Kafiristan when he wrote (Journ. As. Soc. Beng. xxviii, p. 332, 1859), ``In some of the warmer parts of Kafiristan, in the densely wooded districts, monkeys of the largest kind are found, but are not very numerous,'' I am now inclined to think the species he referred to may have been a Langur. The credit, however, of discovering this race of <i>M. mulatta</i>in the Chitral district belongs to Sir Henry McMahon (Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, 1xx. pp. 4-5, 1901), who reported, ``Monkeys are to be found in the lower end of the Chitral Valley. Capt. Gurdon saw a troop of them at Mirkandi, on the bank of the Chitral River, only 4,000 ft. above sea-level. The general characteristics seem to be those of <i>Macacus rhesus</i>, but all the specimens I have seen have, instead of a tapering tail, a tail of about 8 in., coming to an abrupt end as if cut as if cut off like a fox-terrier's.'' Capt. H. Fulton (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xiv, p. 758, 1909) subsequently observed this Macaque in Chitral and, identifying it as the lower end of the Chitral Valley in summer on the right bank of the river. They come up as far as the Utzun Valley in troops at 5,000 ft., and probably come over the pass into Utzun from Kafiristan Valley'</p>

Soc. xxvii, p. 669, where the involved synonymy of this species, due to Anderson's confusion of it with <i>M. mulatta</i>, is unravelled. (For synonymy and bibliographical references see under the subspecific headings below.)</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The HIMALAYAS, at tolerably high altitudes, from Mussooree through NEPAL, SIKKIM, BHUTAN to ASSAM, thence southwards to the SUNDARBANS; UPPER BURMA, N. Siam (?), and Indo-China, Annam and Tong-king.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>M. mulatta</i>, which it closely resembles in size and in the length and hairiness of the tail, by the entire absence of orange-red  hue on the quarters, by the growth-direction of the hair on the head and by some cranial and dental characters.</p>

<p>The coat is soft and full, wavy or smooth, but without much underwool, and on the shoulders, before the spring moult, may reach a length of about 85 mm. (over 3 in.). The general colour above varies individually from dark brown to lighter yellowish-brown, but the shoulders, nape, crown, and arms are almost invariably brighter and yellower than the hind quarters, legs, and tail, which is exactly the opposite of the condition seen in <i>M. mulatta</i> the hairs however, are scarcely visibly speckled with annulations anywhere; the arms, legs, and tail are approximately the same tint as the adjoining parts of the body; round the face the hairs are black, but to a very variable extent; the cheeks are typically grey, with the hairs pigmented at the tip; the underside and the inner sides of the limbs are pale, mostly greyish-white, with a brownish tinge sometimes on the abdomen; but the underside of the tail is hardly paler than the upper.</p>

<p>The growth-direction of the hair, not recorded in the living animal, is very variable in made-up skins, but typically, at all events, there, is a short median parting just behind the brow-ridges, whence the hair diverges to right and left and sweeps round the sides of the crown above the ears, the rest of the hair on the crown being directed backwards. but in some skins the crown exhibits a distinct whorl, whence the hair radiates in all directions, forming a kind of ``cap'' with well-defined anterior edge much resembling that of <i>M. nemestrina</i> and <i>M. silenus</i>. On the part of the cheek the hairs typically sweep backwards from the face and, meeting the forwardly-directed hairs from the sides of the neck and hind cheek, from with them a low crest below the level of the ear and in front of it. The condition, however, varies in made-up skins. <i>M. mulatta</i> by the</p>

<p>The skulls, at least those of adult {\male} specimens, may nearly always be distinguished from those <i>M. mulatta</i> by the following features:- There is a strongly developed, shelf-like occipital crest, and associated with it almost always a sagittal crest which from the middle of the frontal bones; the margins of the orbits are thicker, the muzzle more ``pinched'' behind the canines, and the posterior nares and mesopterygoid fossa narrower. Also the canines are considerably larger, but the molars are relatively, if not actually, smaller. Some skulls approach those of <i>M. mulatta</i> which comes nearest to <i>M. assamensis</i>, is the large Chitral form, <i>memahoni</i>.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> of <i>assamensis</i>, Assam, ``possibly from the hills to the northward,'' according to Blanford; of <i>coolidgei</i>, Hoi Xuen, Annam.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---ASSAM, the MISHMI and NAGA HILLS; UPPER BURMA; ? the SUNDARBANS; Tong-king and Annam.</p>

<p>Tail short, usually considerably less than a third, and always much less than half the length of the head and body, and only a little longer than the foot.</p>

<p>Anderson gave the measurements of McClelland's type a mounted specimen, as: head and body 26&#xBE; in., over the curves; tail 9&#xBC; in.,probably including the terminal hairs. These dimensions, making allowance for the method of measurement, agree tolerably well with those of the two adult {\male} specimens  from the Tebang River, 2,000 ft., in the Mishmi Hills (Wells) entered below. Unfortunately no flesh-measurements were taken of a considerable number of examples from Mokokchung, 6,000 ft., in the Naga Hills, but on the dried skins the tails are obiously short. The young specimen in the table from the Adung Valley, 6,000 ft., Upper Burma, lat. 28&#xB0; 10&#2032; N., long. 97&#xB0; 40&#2032; E., has the tail rather more than one-third the length of the head and body, but only a little longer than the foot. It was collected by Lord Cranbrook. The measurements of the two {\male} specimens from the Mishmi Hills suggest also that this race is a little larger than the next; but the evidence is not sufficient to establish that point.</p>

<p>There is nothing distinctive in the coat, which varies seasonally from about 40 to 80 mm.; the colour also is individually variable to a certain extent, darker or lighter browner in accordance with the amount of yellowish-buff in the pelage; but an unmeasured immature specimen collected on the Tuzu River north of Tamanthi, on the Upper Chindwin, 460 ft., (McMillan), is unusually brightly tinted, almost reddish-ochreous, on the head, nape, and shoulders, with a yellowish wash over the hind quarters and legs, This may be a juvenile character, but it is not certain that the specimen belongs to this race.</p>

<p>Further information is also required about the representatives of this species that occur in the Sundarbans, whence Anderson had at least one specimen (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1872, p. 529), as well as several examples of <i>M. mulatta</i>. In this low-lying district, the exact spot being about 50 miles east of  Calcutta, might well occur a race distinct from typical <i>assamensis</i>, which is found at tolerably high altitudes.</p>

<p>This race extends to Indo-China, Osgood described specimens from Annam and Tong-king as representing a new race, <i>M a. coolidgei</i>, and diagnosed it as differing from <i>assamensis</i> by its decidedly shorter tail, more greyish coloration, and possibly heavier dentition. But he compared his specimens with Sikkimese, not Assamese, skins; and the flesh-measurements he gave of two adult {\male} specimens show the tail to be considerably less than half the length of the head and body. Judging from the two specimens, including the type in the British Museum, I consider <i>coolidgei</i> to be a synonym of typical <i>assamensis</i>.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.--- The HIMALAYAS from Mussooree through NEPAL ``the northern range of hills exclusively'' (Hodgson), and SIKKIM, from 2,000 to about 6,000 ft., to BHUTAN.</p>

<p>Distinguished from typical <i>assamensis</i> by the actually and relatively longer tail, which typically is considerably more than half the length of the head and body and about twice the length of the foot; also possibly, by being a little smaller The average lengths of the head and body and of the tail in five adult {\male} examples from Sikkim are 22&#x2156; in and 13 in., whereas the same averages of the two adult {\male} examples of typical <i>assamensis</i> from the Mishmi Hills are 25&#x2157; in. and just under 8 in.</p>

<p>The only available specimens of this race measured in the flesh, according to modern methods, and supplied with full particulars of dates, altitude, etc., were collected for the Survey by Crump and Baptista in Darjeeling and Sikkim; but there is no reason to doubt that these belong to the same race as the Nepalese form named <i>pelops</i> and as the Bhutan form named <i>problematicus</i>. At all events the types of those two forms, as well as of <i>rheso-similis</i>, and all Hodgson's Nepalese skins, have long tails like the skins from Sikkim.</p>

<p>The coat varies from about 55 to over 70 mm. in length on the shoulder; the colour is also individually variable in accordance with the amount of buffy 
yellow in the pelage making it lighter or darker brown. An immature specimen from Rongli, Sikkim, 2,700 ft., brighter tinted than the adults on the head, nape, shoulders, and arms, and is comparable to the specimen provisionally assigned to typical <i>assamensis</i> from the Upper Chindwin River in Burma, but is not so bright on the fore quarters, and lacks the yellow wash on loins and legs.</p>

<p>The recorded weights do not coincide with size. A {\male} from the Mishmi Hills was 23 1b.; the first {\male} on the list from Darjeeling was 25 1b. and the {\male} from Chuntang; 28 1b.</p>

<p>The measurements inthe table (p.57) suggest that {\male} skulls of typical <i>assamensis</i> are a little larger than those of <i>pelops</i>.</p>

<p>The two skulls of <i>assamensis</i> from the Mishmi Hills differ greatly in the shape of the facial profile. In the first the area between the brow and the anterior nares is comparatively lightly concave and long, the nasals measuring 47 mm. In the second the area is deeply concave and short, the interorbital septum being nearly vertical and the nasals measuring only 31 mm. But this skull was damaged during life in the premaxillary region, and was shorted by about 5 mm., and its total and condylobasal lengths, set in brackets, are estimated.</p>

<p>In the case pf <i>pelops</i> a point to notice is the great difference in size between the largest and smallest skulls from Darjeeling. The former came from Sakiapokhu, the latter from Pashok. The skull in its general form and size recalls in many respects the skulls of <i>M. mulatta</i>.</p>

<p>Crump reports that this Macaque occurs throughout Sikkim and Darjeeling at low elevations, its favourite zone in cold weather being from 2,000 to 4,000 ft.As a rule it frequents heavy forest, where it occurs in large companies. Its ordinary call-note is a loud ``pio,'' rather a musical sound , and frequently repeated Its warning cry is the same but uttered once by the sentinel, which is generally on the look-out high up in a tree. On hearing it the whole band descends to the ground and moves away in absolute silence, concealed by the dense undergrowth. It is hunted and eaten by the Lapchas, who think its flesh has medicinal properties. Owing to persecution on this account, and no doubt also to is fondness for raiding maize-fields as recorded on thr label of one specimen, this Macaque is exceedingly shy and wary in certain patrs of Sikkim, but on the Nepal border, where it is presumbly unmolested, it is much more fearless.</p>

<p>The head and body of this {\female} from Rungbong Valley, Darjeeling, 5,200 ft., were given as 620 mm. (&#x208C;24&#x2158; in.), but since the skull is considerably shorter than in the {\male} examples from Sikkim, there is, I think, no doubt that 620 was meant for 520, and I have assumed the latter number to be correct.</p>

<p> <i>Macacus nemestrinus</i> of most subsequent authors. (For bibliography and synonymy of British Indian subspecies see below.)</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---From UPPER BURMA and ARAKAN to Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.</p>

<p>A large or very large Macaque, the typical form the largest of the head and body on the average about one-third, mostly covered with short hair throughout, sometimes with a small terminal tuft and carried in an elevated arch above the anus. Hairs on the crown short, radiating from a whorl and forming a very definite ``cap'' differentiated from the hairs behind the brow, on the temples, and sides of the crown by colour or direction of growth or both combined. Hairs on fore part of the cheek and temples growing backwards or obliquely upwards to meet the forwardly directed hair in front of the ear, and on the hinder part of the cheek to form a crest or conspicuous thick fringe which curves over the top of the ear on each side of the crown. The penis is long, with the glans of normal form and irregularly subspherical. The female has a conspicuous, monthly swelling of the external genitalia at pairing time.  </p>

<p>The skull varies considerably in shape and size, the jaws in the typical form, which does not enter the British Indian area, being exceptionally long, almost ``baboon-like''; but in the adult{\male} it is never so muscularly developed as an <i>M. assamensis</i> and <i>M.speciosa</i>, having a comparatively small occipital crest, and the temporal ridges, typically some distance apart, seldom meeting to form a sagittal crest even on the parietals.</p>

<p>The typical form of this Macaque came from Sumatra. It is also found in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, but does not extend northwards into British Burma ,although Blanford, despite the evidence to the contrary supplied by Tickell (see below, p. 62), ascribed the Tenasserim Pig-tail to typical <i>nemestrina</i>, and gave a composite description of it derived from two forms of the Pig-tail and from skulls of three species of <i>Macaca*</i>.</p>

<p>Owing to the errors into which Blanford was led, partly from want of properly localized material, I have included in the following key to the races of British Indian Pig-tailed Macaques the distinguishing characters of the typical form.</p>

<p>    <i>\'b</i>. Hair generally inconspicuously annulated;

<p>Kloss in 1919 was the first author to refer all the described Pig-tailed Macaques to a single species on the evidence of a specimen from Trang in the Malay Peninsula intermediate in colour between typical <i>nemestrina</i> and <i>leonina</i>.

<p>General colour comparatively pale, with an individual tendency to erythrism, ranging from greyish-olive to buffy-yellow, russet or golden-ferruginous, these tints being specially noticeable on the long hairs of the shoulders, which are brighter than the back, the lumbar and sacral regions being duskier, especially in the middle lines; hairs of the upper side, as a rule, profusely annulated with buff, yellow or russet, and dark brown or black bands. These vary in distinctness, being less conspicuous on the hind back and legs than on the shoulders and arms, and may be quite inconspicuous, especially in the old faded coat before the moult sets in Crown the same tint as the nape or darker; cheeks greyish or buffy, the hairs forming a longish and thick apically annulated fringe. Underside greyish-white, with some darker annulations on the abdomen and the inner side of the limbs in some specimens. Buttocks grey or buffy, sometimes indistinctly annulated sometimes sharply contrasted with the back. Tail usually with whitish fringe at the base on each side; its upper side dark and contrasted with the paler hue of the loins.</p>

<p>*This synonymy is based on descriptions of the type of <i>leoninus</i>, on the type of <i>andamanensis</i>, on several examples from Tenasserim and the Mergui Achipelago, whence came Millaer's examples of <i>adusta</i> and <i>insulana</i> respectively, and on others from Siam referred by Kloss to <i>indochinensis</i>. The alleged differences between these forms seem individual not racial, and they all agree tolerably closely with Blyth's description of the type of <i>leoninus</i> and with the independently published descriptions of it by Anderson, Elliot, and Koss, who saw it in Calcutta. Elliot substituted the name <i>andamanensis</i> for <i>leoninus</i> under the mistaken belief that <i>leoninus</i> was preoccupied in the genus <i>Macaca</i> by <i>Simia leonina</i> Shaw (Gen. Zool. i, p. 34. 1800), which he relegated to the synonymy of the species described below as <i>Macaca silenus</i>. In this he was followed by Kloss; and unwisely, by myself, without verifying the reference. On consulting Shaw's work I find there is no occasion for the change. The name <i>leonina</i> was given by Shaw to a monkey, described by Buffon, and believed to have come from Abyssinia which agrees with no species of <i>Macaca</i>, and differs essentially from <i>M. silenus</i> in the tail being longer than the head and body; the former measuring 27 in., the latter 24 in., the precise dimension attesting their derivation from an actual specimen. I am unable to identify <i>Simia leonina</i>, but its general features, apart from the long beard, agree better with John's Leaf-Monkey (<i>Kasi johnii</i>) than with <i>M. silenus</i>.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to resuscitate the appropriate name <i>leonina</i> for the Burmese Pig-tailed Macaque and drop the inappropriate name <i>andamanensis</i> given to a specimen not indigenous in the Andaman Islands. According to Hamilton (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1870, p. 220) it was one of several imported from the adjoining mainland of Burma. Quite possibly it came from Akyab in Arakan, the home of typical <i>leonina</i>. At all events Tickell, in his MS., said that the Pig-tailed Macaque, which he know in Tenasserim in habited the hills to the interior of Akyab, and was exported alive from that seaport and taken to Chittagong. Equally likely some were taken thence to the Andamans.</p>

<p>The measurements of the specimens from Chanpang and Red Point, Tenasserim, and from Chance Island are taken from Miller's records of <i>adusta</i> and <i>insulana</i> respectively. The specimens from Bankachon and H'Kamti were collected and measured by G.C. Shortridge, and the one from Sullivan Island by C. Primose. The tail varies from considerably more to a little less than the length of the foot.</p>

<p>Miller's {\male} specimen from Champang and red Point weighed 20 1b. and 14 1b. respectively, his two from Chance Island 13&#xBE; 1b. the {\male} from Bankachon was 18 1b. and the {\female} 10&#xBC; 1b. The {\male} specimens, althought not very much shorter in the head and body, were much lighter than three adult males of the typical form from Sumatra, which were 25, 27, and 30 1b, respectively, as recorded by Miller.</p>

<p>The skulls of this Macaque are about the same size as those of <i>M mulatta villosa</i> True, and I am unable to find any constant difference between the two particularly in the {\female} skull*, but the {\male} skull seems to have slightly more elevated brows and stronger temporal ridges. The skull of the adult {\male} from Bankachon is, unfortunately, not available; but the skull of an old {\male} from Tavoy figured by Tickell in his MS. has the ridges strong and converging posteriorly, only about 7 mm. apart on the parients, with a short median ridge between them. In the skulls of typical <i>M.nemestrina</i> that I have seen the ridges are farther apart, and this is accompanied by longer jaws. But the difference in size between these two races is not always very great. For instance, the skull of an adult {\male} of <i>nemestrina</i> from Perak is only 143 mm. in total lengt, but two from Pahang and Selangore are 151, a third from Borneo is 161, and an adult {\female} from Sumatra is 134 mm., indicating considerably greater average length in <i>nemestrina</i>. (For measurements of<i>leonina</i>, see p. 64.)</p>

<p>* By an error in registration two skulls carry the same number as the skin of the {\female} <i>andamanensis</i> collected by Shortridge at H'Kamti on the Upper Chindwin. One is the skull of <i>M. mulatta</i>, the other of <i>M.nemestrina leonina</i>, and I do not know which of the two belongs to the skin.</p>

<p>Tickell* in his MS. recorded this Macaque from Ye in Amherst where it occurs in the thick jungles at the foot of the hills, but is not nearly so common as the ``fishing monkey'' (M. irusaurea), although it seems to increase in numbers farther south in Tenasserim. The voice of the young is the same, he says, as that of the Rhesus (<i>M. mulatta</i>). Shortridge, who was acquainted with it at Bankachon, says it is plentiful there, though not to the same degree as the Gibbon (<i>H. lar entelloides Geoffr</i>.) and the Leaf-Monkey (<i>Trachypithecus obsurus</i> Reid). It is gregarious, and when occurring round villages is said to be very destructive to the rice-fields. He found the cheek-pouches filled with picecs of this cereal. With the specimen Shortridge collected at H'Kamti was a note stating that it was secured on the west bank of the Chindwin River and probably represented a hill-form, possibly common enough round Sarameti and other hill regions dagged</p>

<p>*This able naturalist, to whom Blanford was much indebted, published an admirable description, illustrated by good coloured figures, of a {\male} and two young specimens of this Macaque. There is also an accurate figure of the skull of a very old {\male}. The description and the figures agree as precisely as can be with the description of <i>leonina</i> given above. If Blanford, who saw this account, had paid heed to it, he might have seen that the Pig-tail of Tenasserim is not typical <i>nemestrina</i>, and that its skull has the characters he regarded as distinctive of his <i>leoninus</i>.</p>

<p>Dagged Anderson's accounts in 1878 and 1881 of the specimens of <i>M.leoninus</i> and <i>M. assamensis</i> he said he collected near Bhamo are so confused that I cannot make up my mind whether he secured a {\female} of each or of only one of the species, and, if only one, which it was.</p>

<p>This description is taken from the type and only available specimen. The dimensions (in English inches) of the dried, made-up skin are:-Head and body     24&#xB1;, tail 8&#xBD;, foot 6. The size is about the same as in the adult {\male} of <i>n. leonina</i>.</p>

<p>The skull, well figured by Anderson, is about the same length as that of <i>n. leonina</i> and has similar short jaws; but the cranial portion is relatively short, owing to the unusual uptilting of the occipital plane. It is exceptionally massive, with high thick brow-ridges and strong temporal crests about 16 mm. apart on the frontals, but coalescing on the parietals to form a	low, thick, sagital crest, a feature not observed in any skull of <i>n. leonina</i> or typical <i>nemestrina</i>. These features, however, may be a question of age, the skull being that of an old animal.</p>

<p> The monkeys has a curious history. It was imported to the Zoological Gardens in London in 1870 as a full-grown animal and was there seen by Blyth, who identified it as his <i>leonina</i>, overlooking the marked differences in colour between it and his type of <i>leoninus</i> from Arakan. Sclater naturally accepted this-determination and was followed by Anderson and Blanford. Sclater published a coloured plate of it, with the type of <i>andamanensis</i> in the background, and considered them to represent the sexes of the same species. Later Anderson saw Blyth's type of <i>leoninus</i> in Calcutta and described it, as well as this specimen, without commenting  on the differences between them. These were detected by Kloss, who was naturally completely puzzled by the discrepancies.</p>

<p>There is no proof that the type of <i>blythii</i> falls within the limits of the fauna of British India. But Elliot says that he saw a living specimen in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens which resembled it. Not improbably this specimen came from some nearby district, possibly northern Burma or Assam.</p>

<p>I have tentatively suggested that the specimens named <i>M. nemestrina</i> which McCann collected at Changchang Pani, 500 ft., in the Naga Hills, may represent this race, because he says that have much longer and darker coats than a specimen from Bankachon sent to Bombay as <i>M. adusta</i>, the hairs being tipped with brown, especially on the hinder dorsal region. He had three adult {\female}{\female} and one immature {\male}, which in the flesh resembled Sclater's figure of <i>M. leonina</i>, the reference presumably being to the {\male} in the foreground. His description suggests that they are not as dark as the old {\male}, the type of <i>blythii</i>, the but the difference may be a matter of sex and age. His largest {\female} measured: head and body 22&#x2155; in. tail 7&#x2157;, foot 6. Two dimensions of its skull are entered in the list below.</p>

<p>Assuming the correctness of this identification, <i>M. n. blythii</i> inhabits, according to McCann, the same forests in the Naga Hills as <i>M. speciosa</i>, but is far more arboreal and keeps strictly to dense evergreen forests, which makes it difficult to observe and secure. This may account for the comparative rarity of specimens of this race museums and for its having been previously, so far as I am aware, unrecorded from Assam.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type of silenus</i>, ``Ceylon''*; <i>albibarbatus</i>, ``Ceylon'' ; <i>ferox</i>, ``Ceylon.''</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---S.W. INDIA, the WESTERN GHATS, principally of TRAVANCORE and COCHIN, but alleged to occur from about 14&#xB0; N. lat. to Cape Comorin.</p> 

<p>Distinguished from all the other species of <i>Macaca</i> by the combination of two characters : the growth of the hairs on the temples and cheeks to form a long, thick, dark grey or brownish-grey ruff or mane, which hangs down on each side of the face like long whiskers and passes on to the throat as a shorter, paler beard, and by the shining, black hue of the rest of the head, body, limbs, and tail, although the underside, at least in the young, may be dark brown or greyish-brown.</p>

<p>*Nearly all the early records of this species give Ceylon as its locality, and many of them, including the popular natural histories, cite it in consequence as the ``Ouanderu'' or ``Wanderoo,'' the vernacular name for the so-called ``Purple-faced Leaf-Monkey'' or Langur of that island. One or two comparatively recent authors have objected to the use of <i>silenus</i> as its specific name because of the discrepancies between Linn{\ae}us's description of <i>silenus</i> in the 10th and 12th editions of the `Systema.' But I agree with Thomas that the description of 1758 is sufficiently exact to justify Schreber's allocation of the name in 1775, and the acceptance of it by nearly all recent zoologists, Elliot being an exception, in calling it <i>albibarbata</i>. For the erroneous application of the name <i>leonina</i> to this Macaque see p. 60, footnote.</p>

<p>Lion-tailed Macaque (<i>Macaca silenus</i>).</p>

<p>Despite the striking and distinctive appearance of this species, there is no doubt that it is not very remotely related to <i>M. nemestrina leonina</i>. The arrangement of the hairs on the crown and cheeks is the same, and the huge mane or ruff is merely an exaggeration of the shorter ruff seen in the Burmese Pig-tailed Macaque. In both of them, also, the coat is in general long and full, and the hairs of the greater part of the tail are short, although in <i>M. silenus</i> the terminal tuft is apparently always present and larger, and the tail itself is longer typically, apparently about two-thirds the length of the head and body and about twice as long as the foot. Additional resemblances to <i>M. nemestrina</i> are found in the structure of the penis in the {\male} and the occurrence of the catamenial  swelling in the {\female}, as recorded in my paper (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1926, p. 1571.)</p>

They may be flesh-measurements, but the dimensions given by Elliot were admittedly taken from the made-up skin; and there is very little doubt that Anderson's were also. The tail of Anderson's specimen is relatively very short, suggesting that the head and body may be stretched. The records, for what they are worth,show that <i>M. silenus</i> is about the same size as <i>M. nemestrina leonina</i>.</p>

<p>The skull* of this Macaque is little known. Anderson described one of an adult {\male} as characterized by its widely bulging zygomatic arches, greatly developed orbital ridges, etc. The only adult skull I have seen is that of a {\male} from Cochin presented by Sir Frank Colyer, which unfortunately, has its occipital area broken away; hence the total and condylobasal lengths entered on the table (p. 64) were estimated; but it agrees with Anderson's skull in the expected zygomata, prominent brow-ridges, and other points. The temporal ridges are well defined and 13 mm. apart on the frontoparietal suture, but converge, without apparently meeting, on the parietals. The muzzle is longer than in the type of <i>M. n. blythii</i>; but the facial profile is very similar to that of the subadult {\male} <i>M. n. leonina</i> from Sullivan's Island.</p>

<p>In the Nelliampathi Hills, according to R.P. Kinloch, this Macaque is rare and occurs in small troops up to about a dozen. It is sparingly distributed throughout the evergreen forest and is a quiet monkey, its call-note being a deep ``O.'' </p>

<p>*The photographs which Elliot published to illustrate the skull of this species were taken from an adult {\male} skull of the Bonnet Macaque (<i>M. radiata</i>) from the Nilgiri Hills in the British Museum.</p>

<p>In 1859 this Macaque was recorded by Baker (Journ. As.Soc. Beng. xxviii, p. 238) as occurring in the Western Ghats as far north as Goa, but only in the lonely dense forests. In Travancore, according to Hill (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1937, Syst, p. 215), it is not found below 2,000 ft., its altitude being usually from 2,500 to 3,000 ft. Like other Macaques it is gregarious, living in parties of from twelve to twenty individuals or more, In the rest of its habits it no doubt resembles its congeners. Baker compared the call of the {\male} to the ``cooyeh'' of a native astray in the forest and trying to keep in touch with his companions. O'Brien secured for the Survey only one half grown specimen at Cotengady 3,500ft., in Cochin, and tersely summed up his impression of the species by writing on the labal ``rare, shy, and silent.'' These attributes help to explain the comparative paucity of specimens in the museums ofthe world.</p>

<p>The general likeness in colour between this Macaque and John's Leaf-Monkey, both being alike mainly black with brownish whiskers, is worth noting as an independently acquired characteristic, probably in response to similarity in habitat.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Tibet, South China, ASSAM, BURMA, Nalay Peninsula, Siam, and Indo-China.</p>

<p>Distinguished from all the British Indian species by the shortness of the tail, which is reduced to a conical, sparsely hairy stump, not more than one-third the length of the foot, and by the excessive elongtion of the glans penis. The hairs on the crown, radiating from a central whorl, are elongated laterally and posteriorly over the occiput, but in the adult are very short anteriorly, leaving a nearly naked area behind the brow-ridges; hairs on the cheeks sweeping backwards, concealing the ears, and downwards to the throat, where they meet the hairs growing upwards from a whorl behind the chin and forwards along the side of the neck, forming with them a tufted crest. Typically, at all events, there is an area of naked skin round the callosities. General colour usually dark brown, but varying from nearly black to reddish, with the underside at most a little lighter than the upper. Face pink In the shortness of the tail <i>M. silenus</i> closely resembles the Macaque from Celebes, <i>M.maura</i>. The tail is also tolerably short in the Japanese Macaque , <i>M. fuscata</i>; but it is still more reduced than in these three species in the so-called ``Gibraltar Ape,'' <i>M sylvana</i>, which is indigenous in Morocco. But <i>M. speciosa</i> differs fundamentally from these species, asit does from all the other species of Cynomorph Primates, in the structure of the glans penis, which is remarkably long, gradually tapers to a slightly upturned  point, and is supported by a correspondings long bone, <i>baculum</i>. This peculiarity was first described by Anderson (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1872, p. 209) and later by Murie in the same volume (p.784), who however, wrongly identified his specimen as a  Japanese Macaque. The systematic importance of this structure was first insisted on by de Beaux (Giorn. Morf. dell' Uomo e del Primati, i, pt. 1, 1917) and independently by myself (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. 9 vii, 224, 1921, and later, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1925, p. 1557). If <i>M. speciosa</i> be regarded as representing a distinct geneus or subgenus on account of the peculiarity of the penis, the name available for it is <i>Lyssodes</i> Gistel, 1848. </p>

<p>Fig. 18.---Skull of adult {\male} stump-tailed Macaque (<i>Macaca speciosa speciosa</i>), from the Dikchu River, Naga Hills.</p>

<p>Considering the great differences between this species and <i>M. assamensis</i> McClell. in the length of the tail and the structure of the two are not easily distinguishable, that of <i>speciosa</i> having similar massive brows and orbital margins, well developed occipital and sagittal crests, large upper canines, etc.; but it is on the whole more masssive, and has the outer edge of the orbits more vertical, straighter, and less concave where they pass into the anterior root of the zygomatic arch.</p>

<p>Many specific or subspecific names have been given to Macaques with the short tail and crimson face,described by Cuvier as characteristic of the type of <i>speciosus</i>. There is no doubt that all belong to that species, but the number of subspecies is as yet unsettled. I provisionally assign the British Indian representatives to two subspecies, a northern and a southern.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type of speciosa</i>, ``E. Indies''; of <i>brunneus</i>, Kakhyen Hills, east of western Kwantung; of <i>pullus</i>, near Kuatun in Fukien.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---ASSAM, UPPER BURMA, S. China, Tong-king, and Annam.</p>

<p>Coat in winter very long,on the shoulders up to about 112 mm. or (4&#xBD;in.). Colour above varying from deep olivaceous-grey to chocolate-brown, the hairs, at least in the olivaceous-grey phase, speckled, but obscurely, with dull buffish annulations; the underside paler, greyish-brown to brown.</p>

<p>Cuvier described <i>speciosa</i> from a coloured darwing that was sent to him of a specimen in the Barrackpore Mengerie, near Calcutta, and Blyth was the first to adopt this name for specimens from Cachar and the Kakhyen Hills, east of Bhamo. Anderson entirely agreed with the correctness of Blyth's opinion, adding that the Macaque illustrated was probably locally caught either in Assam or Cachar; but for no intelligible reason he chose for the species the later name <i>arctoides</i>, given by Geoffroy to an example he received from Cochin China. Blanford also adopted <i>arctoides</i>, because he followed Temminck's erroneous and highly improbable view that the type of <i>speciosus</i> was a Japanese Macaque (<i>M fuscata</i>). I unhesitatingly follow Blyth's verdict and Anderson's reasoning, with the additional reason that specimens from the Naga Hills, described below, agree better with Cuiver's description of the colour of the upper side of <i>speciosus</i> as ``grisvineux'' than most examples of the species, although they are not so grey below and on the inside of the limbs; but a reproduced coloured darwing cannot be implicity relied on.</p>

<p>Anderson's type of <i>brunneus</i> from the hills on the western border of Yunnan, a young specimen, had the coat long, thick, and woolly, the colour dark brown above, washed with yellowish below. Specimens he recevied later varied somewhat in tint and one that was kept alive acquired a speckled, annulated coat during captivity. He also had an example from Cachar, just south-west of the Naga hills. I can find no reliable characters, embodied in the descriptions by which the southern Chinese specimens named <i>melli, easu</i>, and <i>pullus</i> can be distinguished from <i>brunneus</i>.</p>

<p>The only available British Indian examples of this race were collected by J.P.Mills in the Naga Hills, an adult {\male} on the Dikho River, 21 February, and an adult {\female} at Merang-kong, 15 January. The {\male} has the hairs on the shoulder about 118 mm., and the general colour dark greyish-olivaceous above, with the hairs obsurely annulated blackish and dull buff; the crown has a grey hoary tinge, the limbs are a little browner and paler than the back, there is some redder brown on the tail an round the callosities. and the underside is also browner and paler than upper. The {\female} has the shoulder-hairs about 110 mm.; the general colour s very similar, but the flanks and underside are a trifle browner, and the crown not so hoary.</p>

<p>In a good series of skins which he collected at Changchang Pani in the Naga Hills, 500 ft., McCann traced the colour change from th newly-born young to extreme old age, The general colour of the newly-born young is mainly creamy- white, with a light brown tint on the rump and some brown patches elsewhere. The brown increases rapidly in extent and intensity. In the juvenile the tint is all brown. In the adult the coat becomes speckled owing to a varying number of pale annulations, usually about eight to ten, on the individual hairs. In old age the colour is more grizzled, the pale annulations turning grey. In the skin of one aged {\male} there were as many as sixteen annulations on the individual hairs and some wholly grey hairs mixed with the rest. These observations confirm Anderson's statement that his brown example of <i>brunneus</i> become speckled during the time it was in captivity.</p>

<p>McCann also referred to an adult specimen from the western slope of the Divide between the Salween and the Irrawaddy 5,000 ft., which was more ferruginous along the flanks than in the Naga Hills skins.</p>

<p>Two adult {female} skins from Chapa in Tong-king and Col de Nuages, Annam (Delacour and Lowe), are very like my two skins from the Naga Hills, but the hair of the shoulders is only about 75 mm. long, and the Annam skin has a lot of long grey hairs on the crown and nape.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type of melanotus</i> ``said to be Madras''; of <i>rufescens</i>, ``Singapore''; of <i>harmandi</i>, Chantaboun, S.Siam.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---TENASSERIM, the Malaya Peninsula, and Siam.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>speciosa</i> by its thinner, shorter coat, up to about 70 mm. (less than 3 in.), in winter, by its blacker or redder colour, and by the absence or more obscure indications of pale speckling in the dorsal pelage.</p>

<p>The type of <i>melanotus</i> Ogilby, which was probably shipped from the Malay Peninsula or Tenasserim to Madras, is mostly glossy blackish above, browner on the flanks, and still browner below, with the limbs a little lighter than the back, and with scarcely a trace anywhere of pale speckling in the pelage It is a half-grown {\male}, with the hair on the forehead not conspicuously short as in the adult. The dry skin of the face is quite pallid, showing that the specimen cannot be assigned to the short-tailed Celebean Macaque, <i>M. maura</i>, which has a black face. The type of <i>rufescens</i>, bought alive in Singapore, may have come from almost anywhere in the East, but it so closely resembles some skins from the Malay Peninsula that country may be taken as its  home. Like the type of <i>melanotus</i>, it is a half- grown {\male}, with the hair on the forehead longish, but differs in its generally brightish red colour above, with some black-tipped hairs on the head and nape and brighter brown hue below, the pale speckling in the hairs being negligible . The type of <i>harmandi</i> does not seem to differ in any way from that of <i>melanotus</i>. It was described as very deep glossy brown, approaching black above, reddish-brown below, with the face carmine, apart from the blackish muzzle. The young was said to be tawny grey.</p>

<p>Although this Macaque has been recorded from districts in Tenasserim as remote as the Toungyeen River, a tributary of the Salween, in the north and Bankachon, Victoria Point, in the south, the only available skin is that of a subadult {\male} collected by H.Cecil Smith in Tavoy, December. The coat is about 70 mm. on the shoulder and everywhere thinner and shorter than in the Assamese skins, with the hairs browner at the base, a little darker, less olivaceous, and less annulated distally; there is no appreciable reddish-brown on the but tocks, but the crown is a trifle greyer. Bingham saw black specimens at the foot of Mulai-yit and a couple of obviously young individuals; cream in colour, with a rusty tinge above, were recorded by Davison from Bankachon (see p. 77).These were probably not very different from the ``tawny grey'' young of <i>harmandi</i> mentioned by Trouessart.</p>

<p>From the Malay Peninsula, in addition to the type of <i>rufescens</i>, the British Museum has several skins collected at Trang by Robinson and Kloss in December and January. One adult {\male} is glossy black above, with hardly a trace of annulations and no grey on the crown or brown on the rump. A younger {\male} is like it, but browner, and a {\female} is still browner. A young {\female} from Patalung (Skeat Expedition) is tolerably uniformly rufous-brown, yellower on the crown and on the limbs below the elbows and kness, closely approaching the type of <i>rufescens</i>; and a young {\male} from Nangkok Grabi, Siam (Kloss), is very like the {\female} from Trang. The coat in these skins is from about 55 to 70 mm. long. They were identified as  <i>M arctoides rufescens</i> by Robinson and Kloss, who declared that the reddish and brown colour was characteristic of {\female} and young {\male} specimens. There is, however, the skin of an adult {\male} killed in April at Hat Sanuh, near Koh Lak, Rajburi, S.W Siam, of special interest from the closeness of its likeness to the skins from the Naga Hills assigned to typical <i>speciosa</i>. The coat is a little thinner, in no sense woolly, but quite as long, about 100 mm. on the shoulder; the colour is only a trifle browner and less olivaceous, but the hairs are a little more conspicuously speckled with redder annulations. This skin comes nearer typical <i>M speciosa arctoides</i>, provisionally regarded as a distinct race, than any I have seen (<i>cf. infra</i>, p. 75).</p>

<p>The only flesh-measurements of British Indian specimens of <i>speciosa</i> with which I am acquainted are those recorded by McCann in his valuable paper. To these I have added the dimensions (in English inches) of a few from other districts belonging to both races:-</p>

<p>These dimensions suggest that typical <i>speciosa</i> is larger than <i>melanotus</i>, since the adult {\male} of the latter is about the size of the {\female} specimens of the former, and smaller than the young adult {\male} from Kuatan; but that conclusion is not borne out by the skulls (table, p.76). </p>

<p>The female skull of <i>speciosa</i> from the Naga Hills, received from Merangkong, without a skin I identify as <i>speciosa</i> because it has broad orbits, and skin of this species was collected at that locality, as recorded above. The skull of <i>melanotus</i> from the Toungyeen River is the one Blanford identified as an old {\female} of <i>M. nemestrina</i> collected by Bingham in the Meplay Valley. It has no skin, but is unquestionably that of an old {\male} <i>M. speciosa</i>, and the largest recorded.</p>

<p>The type of <i>Macacus arctoides</i> Geoffroy (Zool. Voy. de B\'elanger, p.61, 1831, and Mag. de Zool., Mammif. C1. i, p1. 2, 1833), from Cochin China, apparently represents a subspecies of <i>M. speciosa</i> It was said to be an adult {\male} with the head and body about 32 in. long, and to differ from the type of <i>speciosa</i> in its conspicuously annulated coat. The annulation was red and black, yielding a brownish-red general hue. One this account I provisionally regard <i>arctoides</i> as a distinct subspecies from <i>melanotus</i>, in which there is evidence that the adult {\male} is black or nearly black above and unannulated, and the annulations hardly appreciable even in the browner or redder {\female} and young {\male}. It was the blackish, unspeckled colour of <i>harmandi</i> that induced Trouessart to describe his Chantaboun skin as representing a distinct race from <i>arctoides</i>. Gervais substituted the name <i>ursinus</i> for <i>arctoides</i> (Hist. Nat. Mamm. i, p. 93, 1854).</p>

<p>Geoffroy's description of <i>arctoides</i> suggests that it more nearly resembles <i>speciosus</i> than <i>melanotus</i>. This is not unlikely, since <i>speciosus</i> occurs in Annam just to the north of Cochin. If the two are inseparable, <i>arctoides</i> comes into the synonymy of <i>speciosus</i>.</p>

<p>The records* by Bingham and Davison of the occurrence of this species both at the foot of Mt.Mulai-yit in Tenasserim and at 7,000ft., showing that it is found at comparatively low and high altitudes above sea-level, were confirmed by McCann's statements that in the Naga Hills it ranges from about 500 to 1,800 ft., and was taken at 5,000 ft. on the Salween Irrawady Divide. As might be expected from its abbreviated tail, this Macaque is mainly terrestrial. On the label of one of Mills's skins from the Naga Hills is written: ``A ground monkey which rarely climbs, and is found in bands which may number 50 or more individuals.'' McCann says the parties consist of twenty-five or thirty individuals of both sexes and all ages, apparently under a leader, but that occasionally solitary old males, probably expelled from the troop, may be seen. The party however, seen by Bingham, as reported by Blanford, at the foot of Mt. Mulai-yit, and described as ``large tailless black apes,'' numbered only four or five These like the specimens recorded by Davison as inhabiting a very dense part of the forest at 7,000 ft. on the mountain, were on the ground, and McCann confirms these accounts, stating that the species is found in dense forests and is essentially terrestrial, feeding mainly on the ground and making its way rapidly through the thick undergrowth when alarmed, and only climbing trees when pushed or to feed on fruits or foliage. The alarm-note is a short, harsh bark; but, when feeding, the bands keep up a continuous squealing and chattering and are at all times apparently extremely noisly. They are also expectionally fearless and frequently show fight when driven from potato fields and other cultivated crops, which they are addictedto raiding. Their diet consists mainly of leaves, fruits, and roots, but McCann thinks that they are probably omnivorous-and no doubt rightly, because two young specimens* kept alive at Bankachon by Davison were ``excessively insectivorous, preferring insects to fruit or bread.''</p>

<p>*Communicated <i>in litt</i>. by the observers to Blanford, who inserted them under his account of the Lar Gibbon, being under the impression at the time that they referred to an underscribed species of Anthropoid Ape. Later in his volume he surmised that they might-apply to a species related to his <i>M. arctoides</i> but bigger, His estimate of the size was derived from Davison's guess that one he saw standing erect was about 4 ft. high and Bingham's guess that an old {\female} sent to him would have been 3&#xBD; ft. high upright.</p>

<p>Davison made the interesting observation that they exhaled a peculiarly foetid odour. This, too, was confirmed by McCann, who found that none of his party  wuould tolerate nursing a young captured specimen because of its unpleasant smell, which adhered to clothing. These accounts suggest that the odour, ecidently much more potent than that of other Macaque, which are frequently petted when young, may  be protective, rendering this species distasteful. It possesses, at all events two other attributes often associated with distastefulness, nearly fearlessness and noisiness. The odour no doubt emanates from the skin and is probably restricted to it to it, since, according to McCann, some Nagas will eat the flesh.</p>

Indian and Ceylonese species. The whiskers also are typically much more bushy. But greatest difference lies in the structure of the penis which is small, subspherical glans quite unlike the large, elongated glans of the other two; but, as in them, there is no periodic catamenial swelling in the {\female} at pairing time.</p>

<p>*The type of <i>cynamolgus</i> Schreb, was a specimen, figured and described by Buffon said to have come from Senegal or Guinea. Cuvier accepted this locality when he substituted <i>irus</i> for <i>cynamolgus</i> in 1818 and when he figured <i>cynamolgus</i> in Hist. Nat. Mamm. pls. 30 and 31, 1819. But in the same work (p1. 32, 1825), when he described and figured <i>M. carbonaria</i> (<i>&#x208C; M. irus carbonaria</i>) from Sumatra, he correted the error on the evidence of specimens resembling Buffon's, which he received from the same island.</p>

<p>Distinguished from typical <i>irus</i> and other forms occuring in Malaya, Sumatra, Java, etc., by the arrangement of the hairs on the cheek. In the southern races the long hairs below and in front of the ears sweep forwards and, meeting the backwardly-directed  hairs from the face, from with them the characteristic fringe or crest on each side of the, face, rising sometimes to form a crest on the side of the head above the ear. In <i>(aureus)</i> the hairs of the temple and upper part of the cheek sweep backwards from the face, partly concealing the ear, then turn downloads and forwards towards the corner of the mouth and finally upwards, the general arrangement being circular and resulting in a definite whorl and a small crest low down on each side of the muzzle.</p>

<p>*Geoffroy cited Bengal and Pegu as the localities of the Macaque, which he named <i>aureus</i> on account of the reddish-ochreous hue of the specimens he saw. I have selected Pegu as the type-locality because the species is not indigenous in Bengal. Bl'elanger's specimen, which Geoffroy was told came from Bengal, was no doubt bought in the Calcutta Bazaar, where captive specimens, according to Bl'elanger, were offered for sale. Pegu, on the other hand, is a certain locality for this Macaque.</p>

<p>The characteristic arrangement of the hairs of the cheek, which I have used as the main diagnostic feature of this race, was illustrated, though not commented on, by Gervais is 1854 when he figured, side by side, the heads of <i>aureus</i> and (<i>carbonarius</i>, which) no doubt he saw in the Paris Museum. Tickell's unpublished figures, quoted so frequently by Blanford, also show the same feature in specimens from northern Tenasserim, one sketch indicating, though not emphatically, the hair whorl behind the mouth. I have added <i>vitiis</i>, Elliot to the synonymy of <i>aureus</i> entirely because of its locality, the description being valueless.</p>

<p>* This is the skull of <i>M. irus</i> that Banford assigned to <i>M.nemestrina</i>.</p>

<p>The colour and length of the coat vary considerably in specimens from the same locality in accordance with the moult and independently of it. A skin from Kathema Island, Tavoy (H. C. Smith), 22 April, with the moult just finished, has the hair of the new coat about 13 and 20 mm. on the hind back and shoulders respectively, and the general hue of the upper side at a little distance is dark greyish- or olivaceous-brown, due to the blend of the blackish and ochreousa annulations of the hairs; the limbs externally are  little paler, but the upper side of the tail is black, becoming gradually paler towards the tip; the lower surface and insides of the limbs are ashy grey, and there are some wholly black hairs behind the brow-ridge.</p>

<p>Another with the same locality and date, retains the old coat everywhere, and its hairs are about twice the length of those of the skin in fresh coat. It is also much paler, faded to brightish tawny above, passing into dull ochreous-buff on the flanks and hind quarters, its general hue recalling that of the Rhesus Macaque (<i>M. mulatta</i> (Zimm.)), the hairs having scarcely a trace of annulations, expect on the head; the arms are duller and paler than the body, the legs below the knee are grey, the tail is only slightly brownish above, and the underside is paler grey. This skin is in the ``red'' phase, like the type from Pegu.</p>

<p>All intermeditates in coat-length and colour between these two occur in skins from the Tavoy district (H. C. Smith), two additional skins being ``red''; and a good series collected by G.C. Shortridge in Southern Tenasserim between Tenasserim Town and Victoria Point agrees generally with the Tavoy skins, although none of them exhibits the ``red'' phase. But the coat may be longer and richer in colour, an exceptionally handsome skin being that of a {\male} from King Island, 200 ft., Mergui Archipelago (Primrose), October, which has a long glossy coat, 35 and 60 mm. long on the hind back and shoulders, and the colour darker, with deeper black and richer ochreous annulations. Another skin from the Ye Forest near Ataran, in Amherst District, November, is very like the King Island specimen, expect that the coat is shorter. An ``orange-coloured'' specimen, like the type from Pegu, was recorded from Mergui by Blyth in 1875.</p>

<p>The size varies considerably, as shown by the following flesh-measurements (in English inches) of specimens collected for the survey by Shortridge and Primrose:-</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---The only peculiarity in the mode of life of this monkey is its habit of frequenting tidal creeks and mangrove swamps to hunt for crabs, upon which it feeds to a great extent. Shortridge, who came across it in Tenasserim, said that ``although extremely plentiful where it occurs, this species is here [in Tenasserim] confirmed to the neighbourhood of mangrove swamps along the sea-shore and the banks of rivers. Its chief habitat is along the edge of tidal creeks, where at low tide it foods on molluscs, crustaceans, and other marine animals. It was so local round Victoria Point, although swarming along the banks of the Pakchan River, it was not once seen near Bankachon, only a few miles away from the river.'' The monkey does not, however, appear to be absolutely restricted to the coast and river-beds, since Primrose shot one 200ft. above sea-level on King Island, Mergui. Nor does its diet consist solely of crabs. No doubt, like other Macaques, it eats insects as well; and H. C. Smith, who examined the stomachs of a number of specimens secured at Tavoy, found that although a large percentage contained the remains of crabs, these were generally mixed with vegetable food, and in some cases the contents were entirely vegetable.</p>

<p>Tickell in his MS.states that since the tidal creeks in Arakan, at the mouths of the Irrawaddy and in Tenasserim, are the only high roads of the districts, the monkeys have become familiarized to the sight of man and sufficiently fearless to come near enough to pick up rice and fruits thrown to them. This was confirmed by Blanford, who observed them in Pegu follow a boat for some distance. Very naturally also they are not only fearless of water but are adept swimmers. Tickell tells of a wounded male jumping out of a boat, swimming away, diving repeatedly and swimming under water for a distance of 50 yards.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>M. irus aureus</i> and resembling typical representatives of the species from the Malay Peninsular and Sumatra in the mode of growth of the cheek-hairs, which on the fore part of the cheek sweep backwards from the face and on the hind part forwards from in front of the ear and neck, the upturned points of the two hair-streams meeting to from a conspicuous vertical crest which descends from the edge of the crown to the throat; the eye-brow vibriss{\ae} are also less well developed, at least on the average*. The general colour of the upper side and of the limbs is nearly uniform hair-brown, with a faint tinge of drab more pronounced on the sides; the hairs are marked with a cream ring which is sharp on the crown and nape, less so on the buttocks and thighs; the tail is dark drab above, almost black in its proximal half, pale drab below. The underside of the body is pale drab. According to Miller the general colour differs from that of specimens of <i>irus</i> from the Malay Peninsula by being much darker and less yellowish.</p>

<p> <b>Family COLOBID{\AE}</b>.</p>

<p>The essential characters distinguishing this family from the Cercopithecid{\ae} are given on p. 32; but in addition to the sacculated stomach and absence of cheek-pouches, the British Indian members of this family differ from the Macaques in their longer, narrower hands and feet, with the pollex and hallux shorter.</p>

<p>This family of monkeys is represented in Africa by the so called Guerezas or <i>Colobus</i>, whence its name is derived; but the Oriental Region, where it ranges from India, Tibet, and South China to Borneo, may be regarded as its headquarters. In this region there are several well-defined genera, the Proboscis Monkey (<i>Nasalis</i>) and three Snub-nosed Monkeys (<i>Rhinopithecus, Presbytiscus, and Simias</i>), which are unrepresented in the British Indian fauna. The genera occuring within Indian limits are not so well defined from each other. They have been popularly called Langurs, a name open to the  objection that, strictly speaking, it belongs to a particulars kind found only in parts of India. The title Leaf-Monkey, recently adopted by Hill, is perhaps the most appropriate.</p>

<p>*I am indebted to Mr. Miller for telling me (<i>in litt., 1937</i>) about the hair growth on the cheeks and the eyebrows in his skins of <i>umbrosa</i>. In these particulars, he says, they differ markedly from the specimens from the Mergui  Archipelago described by Elliot as <i>vitiis</i>, thus justifying the conclusion I had already reached that <i>vitiis</i> is a synonym of <i>aureus</i>. From a comparison of Elliot's Mergui specimens with Geoffroy's account of <i>aureus</i>, Miller suggested to me that the former should perhaps rank as a local insular race distinguished by its duller colour; but a majority of mainland skins is dull-tinted. The rest of the characters of <i>umbrosa</i> I have entered above are derived from Miller's original description.</p>

<p>.20.---sacculated stomach of Ceylonese Leaf-Monkey (<i>Kashi senex</i>).</p>

<p>Although some of the different kinds are fond of frequenting rocks, or even old building, the Leaf-Monkeys are essentially arboreal, inhabiting for the most part high forest trees and feeding upon foliage, flowers, fruits and seeds of various kinds, sometimes perhaps occasionally taking animal food and but seldom coming to the ground except for water or a garden raid. On the ground they can gallop, and bound along at a good pace on all fours; but it is in the trees that their remarkable agility is chiefly manifested. They run with speed and surety along the big branches, spring lightly from one to another or take prodigious leaps from tree to tree, often landing, spread-eagle fashion, on a mass of foliage. Their structure is essentially adapted to this form of activity. The loins are powerfully developed for the ``take off,'' the tail is exceptionally long used as a balance and the hands are long and narrow to play the part of grasping hooks. The palm is about twice as long as wide, the thumb is greatly reduced in size and nearly functionless, but the four remaining digits are long and strong, the two middle ones being subequal and a good deal longer than the others. The hand differs greatly from that of the Macaques, in which it is comparatively broad and stumpy, with the palm much wider, the thumb longer, and the remaining digits about as long or shorter. The feet also differ tolerably similarly.</p>

            B. The same of Lion-tailed Macaque (<i>Macaca silenus</i>).

<p>There have been many confusing changes in the nomenclature of the Oriental monkeys of this family. So long as they were all considered to represent a single genus they were cited as <i>Presbytis or Semnopithecus</i>, the latter mostly being preferred, <i>e.g</i>., by Anderson and Blanford, until Miller pointed out that <i>Presbytis</i> is the older name. Then Thomas recommended the still older name <i>Presbytis</i>, and in this he was followed by Wroughton, Fry, Hinton, myself, Phillips, and Hill. But <i>Presbytis</i> was later authoritatively ruled out of use because its type-species, <i>veter</i> Linn., cannot be identified from the description, and its type-specimen has disappeared.</p>

<p>In captivity at least the Leaf-Monkeys are sedate and dignified in appearance and behaviour as compared with the Macaques. The latter may be regarded as the ``plebeians,'' the former as the ``patricians'' of the Indian monkeys population.</p>

<p>That the species fall into a number of natural groups was realized by practically all modern systematists; but the overlap in external characters and individual variability in skulls made very diffcult any satisfactory definition of the groups. I made such an attempt in 1928 and adopting the name         <i>Pithecus</i>, divided the genus into three sections, based upon the colour of the newly-born young, namely, the <i>Entellus</i> group, containing the species found in India and Ceylon, in which the young is uniformly black; the <i>Pyrrhus-</i> group found to the east of the Bay of Bengal, in which it is golden-red; and the <i>Ayyula-</i>, also found to the east of the Bay of Bengal, in which it is typically of the ``cruciger''-type, white with a black cross-mark on the back, the group-names being taken from the oldest or most familiar specific names in each section.</p>

<p>But in 1934, in an attempted revision of the species of the <i>Pyrrhus-</i> and <i>Ayyula-</i> groups found to the east of British Indian territory, I took for for these groups the generic names <i>Trachypithecus</i> and <i>Presbytis</i>. The Indian and Celylonese species I left as in my earlier paper, with the remark that, if <i>Pithecus</i> be upheld, <i>Semnopithecus</i> Desm.  (<i>entellus</i>) and <i>Kasi</i> Reichenbach (<i>johnii</i>) would be synonyms of it. <i>Pithecus</i>, howerer was condemned; and Hill in 1934 showed that my association of <i>johnii</i> and its Ceylonese allies with the typical Indian Langurs on the evidence of the colour of the young was wrong. It is true they are black in <i>johnii</i> and in the races of <i>entellus</i>, in which they have been recorded, the only ones known to me, but not in the Ceylon species, to which <i>johnii</i> is very closely akin. Hill therefore in 1936, accepting the burial of <i>Pithecus</i>, divided my unnatural <i>Entellus-</i> group into two genera, <i>Semnopithecus</i> and <i>Kasi</i>, which are respectively precisely equivalent to the two species, <i>entellus</i> and <i>senex</i>, which I adopted in 1928.</p>

<p>The four genera mentioned above occur within the British Indian area; but their distinguishing characters are not very convincing, and in some respects are average rather than absolute, owing to deviations from the typical form which may crop up.</p>

<p>The characters given in the analytical key and in the definitions which follow are taken from the British Indian species.</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>entellus</i> Durfresne.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Practically the whole of INDIA, except the western deserts, from the Himalayas southwards and CEYLON.</p> 

<p>Newly-born young, where known, black throughout. Adult always with the hair behind the brow radiating from a frontal whorl and the eyebrows well developed; hair on the crown sometimes rising into a crest or tuft; on the sacral area (croup) not shorter than on the mid-back; individual hairs of the back comparatively thick, with coarse surface imbrication and somewhat scanty pigmentation in the medulla and cortex (Hill). Male and female alike in colour of the public region. Clitoris sometimes elongated and pendulous, with its tip projecting below the labia of vulva*. End of the penis with median notch on the corana and tumid margins to the orifice. The skull is powerfully developed, especially in the adult {\male}, the brow-ridges being prominent and the area behind them forming a wide depressed platform.</p> 

<p>In the days gone by, before the admission of ``subspecies,'' the Langurs of this genus only known from geographically isolated and extreme modifications of the type, were of course assigned to several distinct species notably by Blyth and, following him, by Blanford, who accepted four, namely, <i>schistaceus</i> fro the Himalayas, <i>entellus</i> from the northern plains <i>hypoleucos</i> from the Malabar coast, and <i>priamus</i> from the Coromandel coast and Ceylon. But Blanford's acquaintance with Himalayan Langurs was apparently almost limited to a few Nepalese skins procured by Holdgson, which are not typical <i>schistaceus</i> of that author, and his knowledge of the Langurs of Peninsular India was apparently equally imperfect owing to want of specimens.</p>

<p>*According to Hill this condition of the clitoris indicates recent parturition. That was not the case in the specimen in which I recorded it (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1926, p. 1554). She was imported alive from India and exhibited in the London Zoological Gardens, and had not bred for some time.</p> 

<p>The Mammal Survey of British India, however, obtained a large number of skins and skulls from many localities in India and Ceylon, providing far more material than was available to Blanford and his predecessors. The examination of this material in 1928 revealed the existence of a number of previously undescribed kinds and confirmed the distinctness of those described by Blyth,  but convinced me that the best way of dealing with them was to regard them as subspecies of a single species because they are definable by characters which actually or inferentially intergrade, the differences being mainly differences in size, in the length of the tail, in the length and fulness of the coat, and modifications of the same style of coloration. all of which fall within the limits of subspecific variation, whether the distribution be continuous or not.</p>

<p>That some of the differences in colour are associated with wetter or drier environment is illustrated by the various forms that inhabit Peninsular India. Typical <i>entellus</i>, occurring Ganges, is mainly characterized by the strong contrast between its black hands and feet and the rest of the limbs, which is pale. When this monkeys is traced southwards on the eastern and western sides of Peninsular India it gradually changes. In parts of the Deccan and towards Coromandel coast, and as far south at least as Kurnool and the Nallamalai  Hills, it is represented by a race, <i>abchises</i>, in which the black of the hands and feet is to a considerable extent replaced by white. Farther south in the hills near Salem occurs a race, <i>priam</i>, in which the hands and feet are wholly whitish, matching the arms and legs, and the pelage is generally paler. But in this kind another feature sets in, namely, the uplifting of the hair on the crown behind the frontal whorl to form a tuft or longitudinal crest. This is not invariably present, at least in made-up skins, and its systematic value is doubtful. Two races with similar crests, but darker in general hue, especially of the limbs, occur farther to the west in S. India, namely, <i>elissa</i> in S.E.Coorg, which has black hands and feet, and a form in Travancore closely related to the Ceylonese race <i>thersites</i>. There is also a form in Cochin, <i>priamellus</i>, known from a single specimen, which, although tuftless, seems to be akin to those with what ornament. These three tufted Langurs from Salem, S.E.Coorg, and Travancore show that in the drier eastern zone the colour is paler than in the wetter western zone.</p>

<p>A similar general darking of hue is revealed when <i>entellus</i> is traced from the plains of the north southward into the wetter zone of the Western Ghats. The most northern of these darker forms <i>achates</i>, found in Bellary, Dharwar, and Kanara, intergrades with <i>entellus</i>, but is on the average darker, especially on the arms and legs, and has a blackish tinge between the eye and ear. A little farther south on the Kanara-Mysore boundary is another form, <i>iulus</i>, which has still darker arms and legs. Farther south, in S.Coorg, is the darkest form of all, <i>{\ae}neas</i>, darker even than <i>hypoleucos</i>, alleged to have come the Travancore, which is nearly intermediate between <i>{\ae}neas</i> and  <i>iulus</i>.</p> 

<p>Proof of the intergradation of all these forms is not yet forthcoming, there is much yet to be learnt about them, and future collecting may increase or diminish the number of local races.</p>

<p>The distribution of the Himalayan forms is discontinuous from that of <i>entellus</i>, which is apparently not indigenous north of the Ganges and Chambal River. Nevertheless the differences between the former and Peninsular Indian forms are practically definable as average differences, justifying Anderson's view that ``<i>schistaceus</i>'' is only a ``variety'' of <i>entellus</i>; and Blanford himself thought typical <i>schistaceus</i> from the Nepal Tarai must be the same as <i>entellus</i>. But neither of these  authors was personally acquainted with the Langur of Kangara and Chamba, <i>ajax</i>, which has black hands like <i>entellus</i> and it is possible that in the past the distribution of these two forms was continuous west of the Jumna.</p>

<p>In this volume I have adhered to my original treatment of these Langurs as subspecies of <i>entellus</i>; but Hill (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1937, pp. 209-11, and Ceyl. Sci. (B), xx, p, 213, 1937) has recently reverted to Blanford's opinion that <i>schistaceus</i>, <i>entellus</i>, <i>hypoleucos</i>, and <i>priam</i> represent distinct species, each probably represented by several subspecies, a conclusion derived, partly at all events, from embryological differences observed between <i>priam</i> and <i>entellus</i>. There will be time to consider the systematic value of this evidence and its possible application to the problem when it has been tested in several specimens of each of the different kinds of Indian Langurs. The matter, however, is of no great moment, since authors seldom agree about ``species'' and ``subspecies''; and some I have no doubt would give full specific status to all or most of the forms to which I have accorded the lower rank. There is also the seeming paradox to be borne in mind that two forms may intergrade and interbreed in one district, where they are ``subspecies,'' and keep apart in another, where they are ``species''.</p>

<p>Owing to the intergradation between most of the races of this Leaf-Monkey and to some individual variation within the limits of each, the construction of a satisfactory analytical key for their ready determination is not an easy matter. In the following key an attempt has been made to enumerate the principal features upon which they have been separated. But of two of the races described nearly a century ago, namely, <i>hypoleucos</i>, and <i>dussumieri</i>, I have been compelled to judge their characters from what the authors said. I have been unable to match any of the skins at my disposal with either of them, as described but both were based upon a single individual.</p>

<p>``Dark slate-grey above with the hands and feet somewhat darkened; the head and underside pale yellow; the coat more or less wavy.''</p>

<p>This epitome of Hodgson's description does not apply exactly to any of the skins, here assigned to  <i>schistaceus</i>, available for examination. The only example from the Nepalese area is a subadult {\female} collected at Hazaria Pathergatti, 300 ft. It evidently differs from Hodgson's type in its paler colour being uniformly pale greyish buffy-brown, not dark slaty-grey, above and on the outside of the arms, with the legs and tail a little paler, the general effect being concolorous, except for the creamy-white head and nape; the chest is yellowish. The winter coat, 15 February, in accordance with the low altitude, is comparatively short, with the hairs subequal and about 50 mm. (2 in.) on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The examples I described as <i>hector</i> from Kumaun may, I now think, be assigned to this race, as Hinton and Fry supposed. They tolerably closely resemble the skin from Hazaria in colour, the general hue of the upper side being slaty-grey inged with buff or pale brown, with the arms slightly darker, more fuscous-grey than the back. But the coat in November, January, and February is longer than in the Hazaria skin, being from about 65 to 80 mm. (3 in.) in length on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The weight of the {\male} from Ramnagar was 38 1b., pf the {\female} 39 1b.</p>

<p>The skulls of the Kumaun specimens assigned originally to <i>hector</i> have the nose projecting, the plane of the nasals being sloped at an angle of approximately 45,&#xB0; a very familiar but not invariable feature in the Himalayan races. But in the skull from Hazaria Pathergatti, which from its locality I regard as typical <i>schistaceus</i>,the nose is not nearly so prominent, having more of a concave dip at the base of the nasals.</p>

<p>Of the specimens I have seen and assigned to this race the only one that came from the Nepal Terai, The type-locality of <i>schistaceus</i>, is the subadult {\female} from Hazaria Pathergatti. This is approximately full-sized, yet neither in its flesh-nor skull-measurements does it exceed large {\female} specimens of  <i>entellus</i> and <i>priam</i> and Peninsular India. Blanford, indeed, thought the Langurs from the foothills of the Himalayas would prove to be  <i>entellus</i>, not <i>schistaceus</i>. But not realizing that Hodgson described <i>schistaceus</i> from the Nepal Terai, of the highlands of Nepal. So far as size is concerned <i>schistaceus</i> is intermediate between the highland Himalayan races and those of Peninsular India. Evidence of the existence of this race in Oudh and Garhwal is supplied by an adult {\male} skull from Bahraich in the former province and of three adult {\male} skulls from Garhwal (B.B.Osmaston), all received without skins. The condylobasal length of the first is 112 mm., and its average in the others is 111&#x2153;. These dimensions are practically the same as in the skull of an adult {\male} from Almora in Kumaun, entered in the table (p.117), one of the specimens I described as <i>hector</i>. These skulls are only 6 mm., about a quarter of an inch, longer in the dimension than the largest skull of typical <i>entellus</i> from Hazaribagh.</p>

<p>Fig.24.---Skull of adult {\female} of <i>Semnopithecus entellus schistaceus</i> from Naini Tal, one of the specimens originally assigned to <i>hector</i>. This skull differs considerably in shape from the skull from Hazaria Pathergatti, but the differences are probably individual, not racial. &#x00D7; &#x2154;.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---In Kumaun, according to Crump, this Langur ranges from 1,100 ft. at Ramnagar to about 7,650 ft. at Khati, but may extend up to a about 9,000 ft. Apparently it seasonally migrates from higher to lower levels and <i>vice versa</i>. It is not, for example, found at Lohaghat, 5,600 ft., in February, but arrives later, in warmer weather. It is common in all the heavy forests, sometimes associating during the day with the Rhesus Macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta villosa</i> True), although the species separate in the evening before settling down for the night. Baptista found it fairly plentiful in Hazaria near the Soonson River, where it was not very shy. The call is ``hoop! hoop!'' generally uttered as a warning cry by one troop.</p>

<p>Regarding the breeding habits the evidence is conflicting Blanford quoted a MS. remark by Hodgson that in <i>schistaceus</i> pairing takes place in February and young are born in April and May, the period of gestation being only two months. This is clearly an erroneous inference. Young born in April and May must be the product of pairing some time in the latter half of the previous year. McCann, on the contrary, found that females in the Terai were pregnant, or with newly-born young, in February. It is not improbable that Hodgson's statement referred to <i>achilles</i>, which occurs at high altitudes in Nepal and Sikkim, since his specimens, originally named <i>schistaceus</i> in the British Museum, belong to that race. If there is a definite breeding season, as McCann thinks, it is likely enough that the young would be born earlier in the warmer Terai than in the colder mountains of Nepal.</p>

<p>An adult {\female} from Lachen, Sikkim, weighted 35 1b. The skull of <i>achilles</i> is a little larger than of <i>schistaceus</i>, exceeding it in condylobasal length by about the same amount as the skull of <i>schistaceus</i>, exceeds that of <i>entellus</i>.</p>

<p>The recorded altitudes for this race are: Chuntang in Sikkim, 5,350 ft.; Lachen, Sikkim, 8,800 ft.; and Gorkha, Nepal, 12,000 ft.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---In Sikkim Crump recorded this Langur as fairly plentiful in the Lachen Valley from about 5,000 to 10,000 ft, Apparently it does not descend below Chuntang. He found it always shy and wary and confined entirely to the heavy forests, where it goes about in troops composed of a small number of individuals. It is a very silent animal, even when fired at, and he never heard its call-note.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>achilles</i> by its much longer shaggier winter coat and colour. General colour above greyish-brown, greyer and paler than in <i>achilles</i>, with the pale hue of the crown less sharply defined as a rule by the greyish tinge on the nape blending with that of the shoulders; also in adults the arms below the elbows and the hands are black or blackish-brown, and darker than the legs, which are paler greyish-brown, with some sooty-grey on the thigh and knee, the feet a little darker than the shin, bordered with white, and with white , hairs on the toes; the tail like the back, but with the terminal three or four inches white; underside and inside of limbs white. The coat is loose and shaggy owing to the inequality in the length its hairs which form a kind of mane over the shoulders, upper arms, and flanks, especially in the {\male}, where the longest hairs may be from 150 mm. (6 in.) to about 240 mm. (about 9&#xBD; in the type); whereas in the {\female} they are from about 100 mm. (4 in.) to 145 mm. (nearly 6 in.).</p>

<p>The skull is about the same as in <i>achilles</i>.</p>

<p>The recorded localities and altitudes of this race are as follows:-Chamba, from 6,000 to 7,500 ft; Kangra, 2,450 to 9,500 ft.; Kulu, 9,800 ft. The specimens from Chamba and Kangra were collected in December, January, March, and April, those from Kulu in June, and the last were still carrying their winter coats.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---The Langurs seen by Hutton at Simla amongst the tir-trees laden with snow were probably representatives of <i>ajax</i>. At Kangra Wells made the interesting observation that the troops of this Langur consisted of a single adult {\male}, a number of females with young, and also young males. McCann later reported the same habit in typical <i>entellus</i> during the breeding season (see below). Wells was greatly  impressed by the muscular development of the largest {\male}, its biceps being quite as large as an ordinary man's. </p>

<p>Distinguished from the races above described, occurring north of the Ganges and in the western Himalayas by its smaller size, thinner, typically shorter coat, the whisker-hairs concealing the ears to a much less extent, by he darker, less contrasted tint of the head, and by the sharp contrast between the black hands and feet and the rest of the arms and legs.</p>

<p>Colour of the upper side usually tolerably uniform, darker or lighter shining sepia-brown, rather paler on the shoulders and head; the crown sometimes noticeably paler than the shoulders but blending through the intermediate tint of the nape; limbs, apart from the hands and feet, and the tail nearly the same as the back, but tail-tip often pale, and the leg below the knee often paler than the thigh.</p>

<p>A {\male} and {\female} from Midnapore weighted respectively 35 and 25 1b.</p>

<p>The range in altitude is approximately from 200 ft. in Midnapore and Palanpur to 1,000 ft. in Hazaribagh.</p>

<p>The Skull of <i>entellus</i> is smaller on the average than that of <i>schistaceus</i>; it is on the whole less prognathous and has the plane of the nasals more vertical, the nose not projecting to the same extent so that facial profile is differently shaped. But there is a skull of <i>entellus</i> from Midnapore with the nose projecting in the way characteristic of the northern races, and in one or two skulls of the latter the nose is approximately as vertical as in the majority of <i>entellus</i> skulls.</p>

<p>Fig. 26.---Skull of adult {\male} of <i>Semnopithecus entellus entellus</i> from Hazaribagh &#x00D7; &#x2154;.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---The habits of this race are better known than those of any other. Blanford described them at great length, and some interesting information, corroborating, extending, and in a few particulars emending his account, have recently been supplied by McCann (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxvi, p. 622, 1934). Probably all the more southern races, enumerated below, on which few observations have been made, resemble <i>entellus</i> in all essentials connected with mode of life.</p>

<p>By many Hindus they are regarded as sacred, and by being unmolested they have no fear of man, and frequently invade villages and houses and make themselves a great nuisance by pilfering food the pillaging fruit-gardens and fields of crops. Away from the villages they mostly frequent high trees and rocky hills, never far from water. They are exceedingly active, and can leap from one tree to another 20 or 30 ft. away, with a drop of perhaps 40 or 50 ft. descent. They bound from rock with similar ease, and run on all fours with a succession of long leaps, covering the ground with considerable speed. They go about in troops composed of females and young of both sexes under the leadership and guardianship of a single large male. According to McCann, who has studied their daily life, the troop sets off in the early morning and spends the foremen feeding and sitting about their food consisting of leaves, buds, flowers, shoots, and a great variety of fruits. Towards mid-day they usually return to their resting place and sit about on branches and rocks, dozing or sleeping for a couple of hours or so. The troop then sets off again to its feeding ground, and towards evening returns homeward for the night, the male being usually the last to retire to sleep when the others have settled down after much quarrelling for places near the ends of the branches-not on the thicker boughs. Every member of the troop is at all times on the watch for danger, and if one utters a warning cry and bolts, the rest follow in the same direction without waiting to investigate the cause. Alarm or anger is expressed by a loud, harsh, guttural cry, uttered, as sportsmen well know, at the sight of a tiger or leopard, and repeated as the beast is followed through the jungle. But, as Blanford says, the cry may be provoked by the sight of a running deer.</p>

<p>Crump supplied the following note on this Langur in the parts of Bengal where he collected and observed them. In the small State of Chainpur they are plentiful and protected. In parts of the Hazaribagh district they appear to be remarkably scarce, only four specimens being seen. A few living on Parasnath Hill are rigidly protected. In the Santara Range, Singhbhum, they are well distributed, though not very abundant. Owing to persecution by the Jumsare tribe, who kill them for food, and by the Kols, who shoot them with arrows when threatening the crops, they have taken to the thick forests, seldom venturing into the open and have become so shy and wary that it was impossible to get near them through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>To the west in Kathiawar Crump found them fairy well distributed in the Gir Forest, although he did not meet with many. In the Girna Mountains, where they are held sacred and are fed by the natives, they were reported to occur in great numbers. At Danta they were tolerably common, and some were seen at Uria; but in and near the town of Palanpur where the Hindoos hold them sacred, they were plentiful, and might be seen on the house-tops and verandahs. Crump also made some interesting observations on their habits at Hewra in Nimar. He saw some come down to the ground from the top of a very lofty tree by a quick succession of a about four vertical drops in an upright position, not as a rule from one thick branch to another, but amongst the foliage. When alarmed and running through long grass they move with great bounds, frequently stopping and raising themselves to their full height to take a look round. He saw one female, playing with her young one, throw one, throw it into the air and catch it by its two hands as it fell. She was no doubt instinctively giving it practice in the use of its hands for grasping branches. These Langurs from Hewra in Nimar were not typical <i>entellus</i>, having paler hands and feet. One of them that was shot is referred to below as an example provisionally assigned to <i>anchises</i>.</p>

<p>As evidence of what he considered to be a difference in the courage and prowess of these Langurs, Mr. Alison Minchin recently published the following accounts of the behaviour of two specimens (`Field,' Oct. 31, 1936). In Ganjam District, on the Coromandel coast, a large male,one of a big party raiding the crops, was attacked by pariah dogs and, being unable to escape, buried his face in his paws on the ground and resigned himself to his fate, without apparently making any attempt at defence. In the second instance another male was the tyrant of a little village near Attikan, robbing the huts as he pleased and was a terror to the pariah dogs. One evening he visited a rest-shed where a man was staying with a fine bull terrier, and was taking fruit off the table when the dog intervened. The first intimation the occupier had of the contest that ensued was the yelling of the dog, and on rushing into the room he found the Langur had seized his assailant by the fore legs and was pulling them apart. On the man's appearance the monkey released the dog and retreated to the other end of the room, but when the man picked up the dog the Langur returned furiously to the attack and made him release the dog, and the desperate fight that followed ended ultimately in the Langur being killed by the bull terrier, which, however, was badly bitten. The Langurs concerned in these two episodes were identified by the writer as ``<i>entellus</i>.'' They were probably referable to the next race, <i>anchises</i>, or to <i>priam</i> (p. 109).</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---South of the area occupied by typical <i>entellus</i>; the CENTRAL PROVINCES, and KURNOOL in the Eastern Ghats.</p>

The figures illustrate the gradual whitening of the hairs when the Langurs are traced from Bengal to the Eastern Ghats.</p>

<p>Distinguished, according to Blyth, from <i>entellus</i> by its paler hands and feet which, instead of being all black and sharply contrasted with the areas of the arms and legs above, as in that race, are mottled, the hands being mixed white and blackish and the feet whitish with dusky black above the base of the toes and on the terminal phalanges, the leg from the knee downwards being whitish, and the coat very long.</p>

<p>The interest of this monkey, of which Blyth had only one specimen, lies in its intermediate in the colouring of the hands and feet between typical <i>entellus</i> and the more southern race described below as <i>priam</i>. Blanford dismissed it as questionably the same as <i>entellus</i>.</p>

<p>In 1928 I provisionally assigned to <i>anchises</i> some specimens collected at Hewra in Nimar, 1,000 ft. (Crump), and at Seoni-Malwa (S.H. Prater), and in 1931 specimens were received from Diguvametta and the Nallamalai Range, 2,000 ft., in the Kurnool district (A.S. Vernay's collection). These specimens are not all alike in the tint of the head and dorsal surface, one from Seoni-Malwa approaching the race described below as <i>achates</i> in the tint of the crown; but all agree with Blyth's description in the reduction of the black on the hands and feet although this varies in extent, and it is to be noted that the skins from Diguvametta Kurnool, the most southern locality known for the race, have the least black on the extremities, thus coming nearer the white-handed, white-footed <i>priam</i>, which occurs in the Palkonda and Shevaroy Hills farther south in the Eastern Ghats.</p>

<p>The flesh-measurements (in English inches) of two examples are as follows:-</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---DHARWAR, BELLARY, and KANARA.</p>

<p>Distinguished from typical <i>entellus</i>, with which it intergrades, principally by its slightly darker dorsal colour, by its paler crown which is buff or greyish-buff, and noticeably contrasted with the shoulders. although not to the same extent as in <i>schistaceus</i> and other northern races, by the blackish-grey tint of the area between the eye and the ear, and by the darker hue of the limbs below the elbow and knee, so that the black hands and feet are not nearly so emphasized.</p>

<p>The weights of the three {\male} specimens, in order, were 30, 35, and 22&#xBE; 1b., and of the three {\female} specimens 27, 22&#xBD; and 17 1b.</p>

<p>The skull is like that of <i>entellus</i>, but is on the average decidedly smaller (see tables, pp. 117-19).</p>

<p>The recorded ranges in altitude of this race are : Bellary, 1,500 to 1,600 ft., Dharwar and the Kanara-Dharwar boundary, 2,000 ft.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---According to Shortridge this race is extremely plentiful in Dharwar, and is generally fearless and inquisitive, easily distinguishing between Europeans and natives and much more suspicious in the presence of the former. He confirmed the observation made in the case of other kinds of Leaf-Monkeys that, when frightened, they can crouch amongst the tops of thick trees and by drawing the branches together become completely hidden. It is equally abundant apparently throughout Kanara, where it extends to the coast. Among the hills round Vijayanagar at Bellary it was fairly plentiful and unusually large. Its habitat is varied, and Shortridge noticed that where it occurs in the open country it is much less shy and suspicious than in the forests.</p>

<p>Newly-born young, probably not more than a few weeks old, from Kanara, dated January 18 and 30 and March 22, suggest the same breeding habits for <i>achates</i> as for typical <i>entellus</i>; but the data are obviously insufficient to warrant the conclusion that the young are born only at that time of year approximately.</p>

<p>The weights of the two specimens were: {\male} 21 1b., {\female} 18&#xBD; 1b. Judging from these two specimens which like those of <i>achates</i>, were obtained and measured by the same collector, G. C. Shortridge, the tail of <i>iulus</i> is as long on the average as that of <i>achates</i>, whereas the head and body and the foot are shorter. The shortness of the head and body is borne out by the smaller skull, although that of the {\female} is a about the same length as the skull of the small {\female} from Samasgi. No doubt the two forms completely intergrade.</p>

<p>In his note on the Langurs of Kanara (<i>achates</i>) Shortridge has the following pertinent remark:-``Adults vary considerably in size and weight and also in the amount of black on the hands and arms specimens from Jog and Gersoppa (below Ghats) being unusually dark.'' The detection by the collector in the field of the characters upon which this subspecies was established supports the view that it is a distinguishable form.</p>

<p>The measured skulls are very slightly larger than those of <i>iulus</i>. The data are insufficient to justify a definite conclusion on that point, except that they are in keeping with the superiority the flesh-measurements.</p>

<p>Shortridge recorded this Langur as fairly plentiful on the slopes and at the foot of the Ghats around Wottekolle and Makut. It is replaced by <i>elissa</i> to the east of the Brahmagiri Hills, which appear to separate the two at this point. He added that he could get no information about the occurrence of of Langurs in North Coorg.</p>

<p> <i>Semnopithecus entellus dussumieri</i>, Pocock, Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxii, p. 491, 1928.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, Malabar coast. (Probably exported from Mahe).</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Unknown apart from type-locality.</p>

<p>Distinguished apparently from <i>hypoleucos</i>, to which it is nearly allied, by the paler colour of the back, which is greyish-brown, not ``deep dusky brown''; by the inner surface of the limbs being brown throughout; like the back, not black below the elbows and knees and white above them; and by the terminal third of the tail being decidedly paler than the rest instead of blackish throughout.</p>

<p>This Langur of which only the type an adult {\female} with its young, has been recorded, is known to me only from the two descriptions, which disagree in one respect, and from the plate which does not agree precisely with either. In its pale yellowish (<i>fauve</i>)  nape and head, contrasted with the brownish back, it evidently resembles <i>achates</i>, <i>iulus</i>, and <i>hypoleucos</i>; but the figure shows no trace of the dusky band between the ear and eye present in <i>achates</i> and <i>iulus</i>. It further differs from those two races in the brown hue of the inner surface of the limbs, which are like the back, darker than the yellowish under surface of the body and contrasted with it. The arms below the elbow outside and the hands and feet are black; but the leg outside is darkish brown to the foot, the tail in its basal two-thirds is darker than the back, and its terminal third is slightly paler than the back. The race differs from <i>{\'ae}neas</i> in being much paler everywhere, except on the hands and feet.</p>

<p>The measurements of the type, taken no doubt from the skin, converted into English inches are : head and body 24&#x2158;, tail 34, which if correct, are about the same as in {\female} <i>achates</i> and <i>{\'ae}neas</i> and considerably larger than in the {\male} of <i>hypoleucos</i>.</p>

<p>Blanford cited <i>dussumieri</i>, without question or comment as a synonym of <i>hypoleucos</i>. But unquestionably he had not the material to justify the affiliation, and the descriptions of the types of the two enforce their separation, at all events until more is known of these Langurs of the Western Ghats.</p>

<p> <i>Pithecus entellus hypoleucos</i>, Pocock, Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxii, p. 492, 1928.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> Travancore.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---TRAVANCORE, so far as at present ascertained. A race known apparently only from the type-specimen in Calcutta, which, according to Blyth's description, resembles <i>{\'ae}neas</i> in its wholly black tail and in the blackness of the arms and legs below the elbows and knees, but differs in having the inside of these limbs white above the elbows and knees and in its much paler head, which, with the whiskers, was described as ``brownish-white, a little darker on the crown,'' and was evidently much paler than the back, said to be ``deep dusky brown.'' In the contrast between the paler head and the darker back and in the whiteness of the upper half of the limbs inside it is similar to <i>achates</i> and <i>iulus</i>, but differs from them in its wholly black tail and in the dark hue of the lower half of the limbs inside. It is thus in many respects intermediate between <i>{\'ae}neas</i> on the one hand and <i>achates</i> and <i>iulus</i> on the other, although its stated locality is remote from those of those three races.</p>

<p>The measurements of the type, an old {\male}, taken no doubt from the dried skin, are according to Anderson : head and body 21 in., tail 36 in., suggesting a small monkey about the size <i>iulus</i>, This conclusion is borne out by the length of the skull, 106 mm., as also recorded by Anderson.</p>

<p>Kinloch identified as <i>hypoleucos</i> a Leaf-Monkey in the Nelliampathy Hills which he described as comparatively silent and occurring here and there in troops of about half a dozen on the northern cliffs, but seldom, if ever, in the evergreen forest. The Mulcers eat it, but do not consider its flesh has the medicinal value of that of John's Leaf-Monkey. But since the name <i>hypoleucos</i> has been used as a general term for the dark forms of <i>entellus</i> found in the Western Ghats, Kinloch's identification cannot be accepted without reserve.</p>

<p>During his recent visit to Travancore Hill failed, in spite of many inquiries, to get satisfactory evidence of the existence of such a Langur there.</p>

<p>*As shown by the synonymy, I formerly called this Langur <i>pallipes</i>, the earliest name given to it, and cited by Anderson, Forbes, and Elliot as valid, but apparently not adopted by either of them because they were unaware that it antedates <i>priam</i>. But although it is perfectly clear that <i>pallipes</i> was givan to the pale-footed Entellus of Southern India, Blyth's remark about it does not, in the strict sence of the word, constitute a technical description whereon a name can be based. He merely recorded it as ``the reputed Entellus Monkey of Southern India, which is quite distinct from that of Bengal, and will bear the appellation  <i>S.pallipes</i>.'' Since the name is not sufficiently important to be established by ``fiat,'' which be the sensible course, and is not sake of stability, to adopt here the name <i>priam</i>, which will probably ultimately prevail.</p>

<p>Distinguished at once from the foregoing races by the presence of an upstanding tuft or longitudinal crest of hair on the crown behind the frontal whorl. This tuft may perhaps sometimes be lost in prepared skins and possibly absent at times in the living animal when moulting ; but it is a normal feature of the race.</p>

<p>The weight of the {\male} from the Shevaroy Hills was 37 1b., of the {\female} from the Palkonda Hills 19&#xBD;1b.</p>

<p>Special localities and recorded ranges in altitude for this race are; Hogainakal and Murther in the Dharmapuri Range, 850 and 950 ft.; Tirtamalai in the Shevaroy Hills, 1,000 ft.; and Dasarladoddi in the Palkonda Hills, 1,600ft. Davison told Blanford that this monkey ascends the western slopes of the Nilgiri Hills to a height of 6,000 ft.; but since only skulls without skins are available, the identification is doubtful. One of the skulls, that of an adult {\male}, taken by Thomas from a head-skin certified to have been tufted, agrees very closely in size with the skulls from the Eastern Ghats and also with the skulls of a couple of specimens from Travancore referred to below. The skull of <i>priam</i>, does not differ appreciably from that of typical <i>entellus</i>. 
</p>

<p>Fig. 32.---Skull of adult {\male}, referred to under <i>Semnopithecus entellus priam</i>, from the Mahendragiri Range. &#x00D7; &#x2154;. (For comparison with fig. 31.)</p>

<p>In the British Museum there are two adult {\male} unmeasured skins, with tufted heads, from Travancore which, although differing from each other a good deal in colour, are darker than skins of <i>priam</i> from the Eastern Ghats. One came from S. Travancore (Col. Dawson), the other from Aramboly in the Mahendragiri Range (A.S. Pillay). I formerly tentatively identified these as <i>thersites</i> on account of their hue. But their skulls, measuring respectively 98 to 97 mm. in condylobasal length, are about the same size as those of <i>priam</i> and larger than those of <i>thersites</i> I have measured. They may represent a race intermediate between the two, but more specimens are needed. On geographical grounds Hills suggested that they might belong to the next race, <i>priamellus</i>, from Cochin; but the only known specimen of the latter, an adult {\male}, has a paler head, without the tuft and considerably shorter skull, with a condylobasal length of 83 mm. and no crest.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---COCHIN. Not recorded elsewhere.</p>

<p>Fig. 33.---Skull of adult {\male} of <i>Semnopithecus entellus priamellus</i> from Cochin.</p>

<p>Colour of back pale sepia-brown and sharply contrasted with the creamy or slightly buffy-white nap; crown a little paler, and brow and whiskers a little yellower than nape, the general hue of the head and its marked contrast with the nape being very much as in <i>achates</i>, but there is no dusky tract between the eye and ear; tail greyish-brown becoming gradually greyer distally, with a small white tip; arms similar to the back outside, but becoming darker distally and blending with the hand, which is deep brown with black fingers; legs externally paler and greyer than the arms, the feet mostly covered with  dirty white hairs; lower side and inner side of the limbs all white or creamy-white.</p>

<p>There are no flesh-measurements of the only known specimen, an adult {\male}, but the skull is small, about the same size as the {\male} skulls of <i>iulus</i> and <i>hypoleucos</i>.</p>

<p>Of the above-described western Indian forms of <i>entellus</i>, which have no tuft on the head <i>priamellus</i>comes nearest to <i>achates</i> in coloration, and not to its geographically nearer allies <i>hypoleucos</i> and <i>{\'ae}neas</i>; but it differs from <i>achates</i> in its pallid feet, in the hands blending with the fore arm, and in its uniformly tinted whiskers, which have no dusky band between the eye and ear. Its affinities are doubtful. In my analytical table of the races of Indian Langurs, in which, as stated they were arranged in accordance with my views of their kinship, I placed it under the same heading as <i>priam</i> and alongside it, attaching subsidiary importance to the absence of the crest. These opinions were confirmed by Hill, who placed   <i>priamellus</i> in <i>priam</i>, which he regarded as a distinct species, adding that the absence of crest in the type of <i>priamellus</i> was not surprising because part of the skin of the brow had slipped. The condition of the crown does not suggest this to me, but, since its hair is thin and short, the absence of the tuft may be due to moulting. On the assumption that the tuft is potentially present, <i>priamellus</i> is distinguished from the other forms of the Langur which possess that ornament--from <i>elissa</i> by the blending of the hue of the hands and feet with the area of the limbs above, instead of the sharp contrast; from <i>priam</i> and <i>thersites</i> by the pale hue of the nape and crown and their strong contrast with the back, and by the noticeably smaller skull of the adult {\male}, and from <i>priam</i> at least, in addition, by its much darker arms and hands.</p>

<p>*Commenting on the this race, Hill (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1937, Syst. p. 210) said he was prepared to admit that Ceylonese specimens might be on the average Largest and darker above than specimens from the Coromandel coast, justifying their subspecific distinction. In the material at my disposal Coromandel specimens (<i>priam</i>) are larger on the average in flesh-dimensions and Weight and also in the skull than Ceylonese specimens (<i>thersites</i>).</p>

<p>&#x22BA; Blyth originally regarded this Ceylon Leaf-Monkey as identical with the Coromandel coast form described as <i>priam</i>. He considered the crest an invariable character, and on the receipt of a specimen from Trincomalee without the crest thought it represented a distinct species and described it as <i>thersites</i>. In this view he was not followed by later writers.</p>

<p>Of the 4 {\male} {\male} and 4 {\female} {\female} from Chiddikulam, Mandeni, and Arucam Bay, whose measurements I recorded in 1931, none, either {\male} or {\female}, was so large as Phillips's largest; but their average length of head and body was almost exactly the same.</p>

<p>Except that the skull is on the average smaller than in <i>priam</i>, it does not appear to differ from it. The average condylobasal length of 7 adult {\male} skulls is 87 mm., about half an inch shorter than in the 2 adult {\male} skulls of <i>priam</i> from the Eastern Ghats.</p>

<p>Fig. 36.---Head of <i>Semnopithecus entellus thersites</i>, the Ceylonese Tufted Langur, drawn by Blanford's artist from a skin from Ceylon referred to by Blanford as <i>S. priamus</i>.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---According to Phillips this Langur is commonly found in the whole of the low-country dry zone, but does not ascend the foothills to any great altitude, and is absent from the wet zone. In its general habits it does not apparently differ from its Indian allies. The troops or family parties, numbering from half a dozen to twenty or thirty, are composed of individuals of all ages and both sexes. Near the villages they are fearless of man because he leaves them unmolested; but in wilder districts they are more timid, especially in the Vedda country, where the jungle men hunt and eat them. They are as often seen on the ground as in trees, especially about rocks and old ruins and near tanks and rivers. They feed upon fruits, leaves, and grain of various kinds, and raid cultivated ground. They are said, indeed, to eat without ill effects the plant from which strychnine is prepared. Practically their only enemy in Ceylon is the leopard, which captures them either by lying in wait or by so frightening them by rushing at the tree in which they have taken refuge that they fall to the ground from panic. This confirms Dunbar Brander's observations on the Entellus of Central India. Breeding apparently takes place at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>Semnopithecus</i> by the colour of the newly-born young, which has the coat tolerably uniformly golden-red throughout. In the adult the eyebrows are less well developed, and only in one race is there a distinct frontal whorl with radiating hair. The hairs of the back also, according to Hill, are thinner, more silky, and have finer surface imbrications, and are pigmented only in the cortex, not in the medulla as well*. The clitoris of the {\female} is small, and contained within the labia of the vulva, not elongated and pendulous as it is in at least some adult {\female} <i>Semnopithecus</i>. In the typical species, <i>Pyrrhus</i> and some others, the sexes differ, the {\female} having a patch of white hair beneath the callosities; but in other species the sexes are alike in the colouring of the public region as in <i>Semnopithecus</i>. </p>

<p>*It would be interesting to know what species of <i>Trachypithecus</i> were examined for this character. It hardly seems probable that the hair-pigmentation is the same in the black Javan <i>Pyrrhus</i> as in the grey Assamese <i>pileatus</i>.</p>

<p>The skull has the brow-ridges less well developed, at least on the average, than in <i>Semnopithecus</i>.</p>

<p>I have seen skins of the newly-born young of several different kinds of <i>Trachypithecus</i>, ranging from Assam to Java, all of the colour stated. The only exception to the apparently was supplied by an example of <i>T. pileatus</i>. recorded by McCann as white. But the young of this species known to me are typically golden.</p>

<p>In the following key to the species here admitted the characters of <i>obscurus</i> and <i>Pyrrhus</i> apply to the races found within British Indian territory, <i>i. e</i>., Tenasserim, not necessarily to all the races found elsewhere.</p>

<p>Locality of <i>type</i> unrecorded, but no doubt Assam.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>,---ASSAM and the adjoining districts of Chittagong and UPPER BURMA.</p>

<p>Size large, face black, the crown from the brow, where  there is no whorl, to the occiput typically covered with a thick mat of soft, mostly erect hairs, which posteriorly overlap the short hairs of the fore-nape and laterally those above the ear and on the temple; hairs of lower cheek long, whisker- like, covering the lower part of the ear, and blending with long hairs low down behind the ear. General colour of the upper side, outside of the limbs, and the basal half of the tail grey to blackish-grey with some long glistening hairs; the incrassate tail blackish in its distal half; the hands and feet also sometimes darker than the fore-arm and lower leg; the underside of the body, the inner surface of the limbs, and the cheeks typically paler than the rest and sharply contrasted, often suffused with red.</p>

<p>* The species described by Blanford (<i>op. cit</i>. p. 38) as <i>Semnopithecus chrysogaster</i>, on the evidence of two specimens alleged to have come from Tenasserim, is not represented in the fauna of British India.

<p>Locality of the <i>type of pileatus</i>, unknown; of <i>argentatus</i>, Sylhet.</p> 

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The Garo, Khasi, Jaintia, and Naga Hills in ASSAM.</p> 

<p>Distinguished by the pale hue of the whiskers, throat, underside of the body, and inner side of the limbs, which are white or whitish, and at most faintly tinged with buff or pale red and are sharply contrasted with the grey hue of the upper side.</p>

<p>The colour varies a good deal individually. A half-grown {\female} from Mokokchung in the Naga Hills, 5,000 ft. (Wells), is pale slate- or smoky-grey above and on the outside of the limbs and on the tail, with the head and hands a little darker; the underside and the whiskers are white, and there is some white on the hands and feet, but the feet are not darker than the legs. An adult {\male} from the same locality differs in having the whiskers and underside tinged with buff or very pale red, the hands and feet darker, and no white on the fingers or toes. An adult {\male} from Tura in Garo Hills, 1,400 ft. (Wells), differs from the last in having the arms and legs paler, the outside of the leg below the knee and the top of the foot being much greyer. An immature {\male} from Lait Kynsao in the Khasi Hills, 2,000 ft., is very like the adult {\male} from Tura, and an immature {\male} from Konshong in the Jaintia Hills, 3,000 ft., has the outer side of the leg below the knee greyer than in the older specimen from the Khasi Hills, and the end of the tail buff instead of blackish.</p>

<p>As recorded by Hinton, on information supplied by Mr. Mills, this race in the Naga Hills is only found in the high cool jungle above 4,000 ft., and never mixes with the next race, which occurs at lower levels on the slopes and in the valleys.</p> 

<p> <i>Habits</i>.-- According to McCann (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxvi, p. 626, 1933), who observed this monkey at Changchang Pani in the Naga Hills, it inhabits dense forests intersected with streams but was not seen to come to the ground to drink, the plentiful dew supplying all the water it requires, and it feeds on buds, leaves, and fruits. It is polygamous, and at least during the breeding season in the winter months goes about in small parties of eight or ten, consisting of a master male, three or four females and young; but there are also parties of immature, non-breeding individuals. It makes a squealing noise at times, but its warning cry is a harsh bark, and, being exceedingly shy, it either, when alarmed, bides and remains quiet in the topmost foliage or takes to flight, making a tremendous noise by breaking and bending the branches as it traverses the forest. This account refers to typical <i>pileatus</i> or <i>durga</i>; but no doubt the habits of all the races are similar.</p> 

<p>* The measurements of the specimens from Changchang Pani are taken from McCann, who identified them <i>pileatus</i>, without nominating the subspecies.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type of durga</i>, Cachar?; of > <i>saturatus</i>, Bara Hapjan in Lakhimpur.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---From Lakhimpur in UPPER ASSAM southwards to the NAGA HILLS, CACHAR, TIPPERAH, CHITTAGONG, and UPPER CHINDWIN to the west of the river.</p>

<p>Distinguished from the foregoing typical race by the intensity of the redness of the whiskers, throat, underside of the body, and inner surface of the limbs.</p>

<p>When Blyth received examples of this race from Tipperah and Chittagong he regarded them as representing the males of his <i>Pithecus</i>, based on a pale-bellied female from an unknown locality. But the difference in coloration is not sexual, nor can <i>durga</i> be regarded as an erythristic mutant of <i>Pithecus</i>, because the two forms do not appear to live together, and there is evidence of their occurrence at different at different altitudes. On the label of an example of <i>Pithecus</i> shot at Mokokchung, 5,000 ft., in the Naga Hills, Mills, the collector wrote: ``Grey-bellied variety much less common than red-bellied, and found at higher altitudes.'' He secured <i>durga</i> at Lakhuni in the Naga Hills at 2,000 ft.,but most of the specimens obtained by the Survey were from much lower levels, 200 ft. at Lakhimpur, 300 and 400 ft. at Golaghat, 400 ft. at Lanka in North Cachar, and 800 ft. at Lamsakhang in the Cachar Hills. Shortridge secured a specimen with ``ginger yellow underparts and whiskers'' at Nansun Chaung in Upper&#x2158; Chindwin, and believed that this race occurs on the west side of the river and the related form <i>shortridgei</i>, on the east side. A skull picked up by Mackenzie near the Kabaw Valley is probably referable to <i>durga</i>. </p>

<p>The locality of the type of <i>durga</i> collected over half a century ago by Dr.Reid, is doubtful. It was first labelled ``Cachar'' and later ``Upper Assam.'' But the point is of no great moment, since this red-bellied Langur is found in northern Assam, at Golaghat and Lakhimpur, and also in Cachar. Although Hinton regarded the types of <i>durga</i> and <i>saturatus</i> as representing distinct species, I consider the differences between them to be due to the age and the ``make-up'' of the skins. The type of <i>durga</i> is darker above and duller below than that of <i>saturatus</i>, but latter is a fresh skin, whereas the former has been many years in the Museum, and is probably soiled and faded. The teeth of <i>durga</i> were supposed to be larger than of <i>saturatus</i>. This is true of the two types as the of skull-measurements shows, but the cheek-teeth of an example of <i>saturatus</i> from Golaghat are only 1 mm. shorter than in the type of <i>durga</i>.</p>

<p>The evidence of these measurements would hardly in themselves justify the opinion that this race is smaller on the average than the preceding two, but the skulls point to the same conclusion, the adult {\female} having the same condylbasal length as the smallest known adult {\female} of <i>durga</i> and being a little less in that dimension, as in the length of the mandible, than the young adult {\female} of <i>pileatus</i> from the Garo Hills.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---NORTH LAKHIMPUR, so far as known.</p>

<p>Distinguished principally from the typical race <p> <i>pileatus</i>, by the absence of sharp contrast in tint between the outer and inner surfaces of the limbs and upper and undersides of the body, and by the slight suffusion of the flanks and abdomen with red, making them brighter and darker than the chest, throat, and whiskers which are white, with only the tips of the whisker-hairs grey.</p>

<p>General colour above and on the outside of the limbs uniformly slate-grey, but the limbs and tail darkening towards their extremities; the inside of the limbs pale grey, blending with the tint of the outside, and there is no pale line invading the hallux on the inner side of the foot; whiskers white, with ashy tips as in <i>tenebrius</i>; throat and chest whitish, but the belly tinged with reddish-buff, becoming more intense laterally where it passes into the flanks.</p>

<p>No measurements were recorded of the only known example of this race, a barely adult {\male}.</p>

<p>This race inhabits the valley of the Upper Chindwin River apparently at comparatively low levels. Shortridge collected it at H'Kamti, 500 ft., and Homalin, 400 ft., and according to him it is plentiful between those two localities and is found only on the east side of the river. He also secured it at Minsin*; and H. C. Smith shot specimens in the Pidaung Reserves, Myritkyina.</p>

<p>* As Shortridge pointed out, Wroughton was misled into describing the skins from H'Kamti as representing a distinct race <i>belliger</i>. The character on which he relied was due to discoloration of the skins by smoke during preparation.</p>

<p> Distnguished from <i>T. pileatus</i>, by the absence of the ``cap'' on the summit of the head, which in that species is differentiated from the hair of the temple by being longer, fuller, and in all the races except one by darker and contrasted hue, the hairs in <i>T. phayrei</i> on the top and head being essentially similar in colour, texture, and length; also in  <i>T. phayrei</i> the dark hue of the face is relieved by a pallid patch on the mouth and more or less round eyes, the end of the tail is not blacker than the back, there is no tendency to erythrism in the coloration, and the size is, on the average, considerably smaller.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> of <i>phayrei</i>, Araken; of <i>barbei</i>, Tipperah Hills*, of <i>melamera</i> Caud Ciaung, near Bhamo.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The whole of BURMA from at least as far north as Bhamo to Pegu.</p>

<p>The explanation of the above-given synonymy, especially the relegation of <i>barbei</i>, is as follows:- In his original description Blyth gave the name <i>barbei</i>, to specimens said to have been collected in the Ye district of Tenasserim, and stated most positively that they resembled Malayan specimens of <i>T obscurus</i>, with which he was evidently familiar, in the light markings on the face, <i>i.e</i>., the pale hue round the eyes and on the lips. But in 1863 he not only changed the locality, on information received from Brabe, but contradicted his first description by saying that the faces were black*. More over, in 1875 he stated that the skins were received without skulls. Anderson, however (Cat. Mamm. Ind. Mus). i, pp.48-9, 1881) when referring to specimens in the Calcutta Museum as Blyth's types of <i>barbei</i>, described two skulls, citing their catalogue numbers. Further, the Calcutta skins regarded by Anderson as the type is <i>barbei</i>, and no doubt the same as these called <i>barbei</i> by Blyth in 1863, have black faces. This is shown by the reproduced photograph of the head of one of them sent by Annandale to Wroughton (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxv, p. 47, 1917) and by the account of the two given by Osman Hill (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1936, pp. 105-8), who came to the conclusion that they represent a distinct black-faced species of Leaf-Monkey from Tipperah. But the evidence cited above shows they are not the original specimens of <i>barbei</i> described in 1847, and there is no evidence that they came from Tipperah if the alteration in the locality applied, as may be supposed, to the original pale-lipped, pale-eyed skins. There is one more point. Blyth was largely actuated in separating <i>barbei</i>, from  <i>phayrei</i> in his description of 1847 by the absence in the former of the crest on the crown, but he subjoined a footnote stating that the taxidermist lad who prepared the skins was positive they had crests when fresh. That, in my opinion, is not unlikely. If so, it is another item of evidence favouring the view of close likeness between the types of <i>phayrei</i> and <i>barbei</i> &#x22BA;</p>

<p>Originally recorded by Blyth from Ye district of Tenasserim; but this was corrected in 1863 to the interior of the Tipperah Hills. Presumably the alteration applied to the original specimen of <i>barbei</i> and not to the one cited under that name at the later date (see p. 131.)</p> 
  
<p>Another name to be considered is <i>melamerus</i>. In 1928 I considered this to be a synonym of <i>barbei</i>, which was regarded as a race distingushed from <i>phayrei</i> by its generally darker hue. But I had only one skin, the type of <i>melamerus</i>, to judge from. Since then the examination of fresh material, notably of a skin collected by Garthwaite near Bhamo, whence the type of <i>melamerus</i> came, convinced me that the supposed differences are individual, not racial.</p>

<p>*The view that the eyelids and lips changed from pale to black in sixteen years is untenable, Skins 100 years old retain the pallor of those areas.</p>

<p>&#x22BA; The source of the confusion about <i>barbei</i> will probably never be traced. But it seems clear that Blyth must have had skins from the Ye district in Tenasserim, whence came the type of the race described below as <i>atrior</i>, which is black-faced, like his examples of <i>barbei</i> described in 1863, But G. M. Allen (Amer. Mus. Novit. no. 429, p. 4, 1930) has recorded as <i>barbei</i> a good series of fresh skins from S.W. Yunnan which have blackish faces and are silvery above and below; and these seem to agree better with Hill's description of the supposed types of <i>barbei</i>, allowing for soiling and deterioration of the latter, than do my specimens of <i>atrior</i>. It is quite likely that specimens resembling Allen's will turn up in Upper Burma and perhaps prove to be <i>T. pileatus shortridgei</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 39.---Head of <i>Trachypithecus phayrei phayrei</i>, without trace of tuft, from 35 miles north-west of Toungoo.</p>

<p>The eyes in the living animal are encircled by a white ring which turns livid and reddish in dried skins. The hair on the crown may or not be raised into a crest, but there is no parting or whorl behind the brow. The general colour of the upper side may be deep, dull lustreless drabby, not reddish brown or buffy or greyish-brown the pale area of the hairs being more or less lustrous; the forehead and cheeks are blacker; the arm below the elbow gradually darkens to the black hands, and the feet are black; the tail above is usually paler than the back; the chin, throat, chest and belly are whitish or grey, and the pale colour extends in both sexes to the callosities and down the inner side of the thigh, fading away inferiorly below the knee, but sharply defined against the dark hue of the outer side of the thigh behind; frequently too it spreads on to the base of the tail below*. </p>

<p>*When the monkeys are in flight, with the tail uplifted, these whitish areas may perhaps act as guide-marks.</p>

<p>One or two cases may be cited to illustrate individual variation in colour in the same district. The type of <i>melamerus</i> from near Bhamo is mostly deep brown above and darkish grey below. Garthwaite's specimen, also from near Bhamo,500 ft., January 12, which, like the other, is crestless, differs in being much paler and greyer, both above and below, and closely resembles a skin from Kin in Lower Chindwin, whereas another from Kin is decidedly darker and more like, although not so dark as, the dark Bhamo skin. In a series of eight skins from about thirty miles north west of Toungoo (Mackenzie), one {\female} January 12, is very dark, lustreless drab-brown above, very like the dark Bhamo skin, whereas in two {\female} {\female}, November and January, the long hairs from the nape backwards have extensively buff-grey, somewhat lustrous ends. The rest of the Toungoo series are intermediate between these extremes. A skin from the Southern Zamayi Reserve, 6 miles north of Pegu (Mackenzie), March 10, is even darker above than the dark Bhamo skin, but has the belly dirty white. This skin is like two from 30 miles south-east of Prome, November 24 (Mackenzie), and it seems to resemble the type of <i>phayrei</i> from Arakan, except that it has no crest.</p>

<p>Fig. 40. Head of <i>Trachypithecus phayrei phayrei</i>, with well-developed trace from 35 miles north-west of Toungoo.</p>

<p>The crest, to which some importance haas been attached, is too unreliable in its incidence,at least in made-up skins, to be used as a systematic character. In the series of Toungoo skins it is present or absent. It is present as a thin upright tuft in one from Kamri Island, Arakan, in the two from Kin in Lower Chindwinm, and in two from Mt. Popa (shortridge); but in two others from Mt. Popa and in those from Prome and the Zamayi Reserve there is no definte crest, although the hair on the crown as in many of the Toungoo skins is long and irregularly straggling. In the dark Bhamo skin the hair on the crown is as long as in some of the southern skins, but it is less untidy and has a generally backward direction. In Garthwaite's skin from Bhamo it has the same direction, but is shorter and smoother.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---The habits of this of this monkey are probably the same throughout Burma. According to Shortridge it is less noisy and less seldom seen than the Indian Langurs (<i>Semnopithecus</i>), being almost exclusively forest dwellers, and rarely frequenting cultivated ground. He found it fairly plentiful on the higher slopes of Mt. Popa, which he considered to be the northern limit of the range of the race to the east of the Irrawaddy, its place farther north and in the Shan States being taken by <i>shanicus</i>. Near Toungoo Mackenzie reported that it is usually found in dense high forest in parties numbering about twenty. On being alarmed the females made off at once with their young, but the males sometimes stayed behind, barking at the intruders. More of them were consequently shot then of the other sex. In flight the whole party follows the same route running along the same branches, jumping from and to the same spots and now and again stopping at the same place for a long look back. Their leaps appear tremendous. Usually they seem to jump into a group of branches or the top of a lower tree, rather than on to a particular branch, ``spread-eagling'' themselves so as to distribute the weight, the tail apparently being used as a balancer. All the specimens he secured were from the west bank of the Irrawaddy; but he saw a troop on the east side of the river. The Burmans, he added, eat the monkey.</p>

<p>At Kin in Lower Chindwin the monkey was fairly plentiful on the west bank of the river, but it was not seen on the east bank, nor on the Upper Chindwin.</p>

<p>At Letsigan, 3,000 ft., Lower Chindwin, in a party of about twenty Mackenzie shot on February 10 two {\female} {\female}, one in milk, the other with a three-quarter-green naked foetus. This shows that this monkey may breed early in the year. It is likely enough, however, that young are born at all seasons. </p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.--NORTHERN TENASSERIM, the adjacent areas of Siam, and thence apparently to Laos and Annam.</p>

<p>Closely resembling typical <i>phayrei</i>, with similar pale eyelids and lips but distinguished by being on the average paler and greyer above and not so white below, the ventral surface being grey and sometimes hardly paler than the dorsal. Crest on the crown present or absent.</p>

<p>This race differs considerably in coat and colour according to the season. This is illustrated by two skins from Mt. Mulai-yit, 5,000 ft. (Davison) which Blanford identified as <i>phayrei</i>, rightly considering them to be the same as the Langur from near Moulmein referred by Tickell to <i>phayrei</i>. One is tolerably uniformly brown above, with some rusty-brown hairs on the arms, hands and feet, so that the hands and feet have lost their typical black hue. The other in fresh coat is greyer, with black hands and feet, and scarcely differs from examples of typical <i>phayrei</i> from Mt. Popa, except that the belly is greyer and the base of the tail the same tint as the loins. Very similar to the last is a skin from Lampha, Tenasserim, 1,000 ft. (A.S. Veray). An instructive series showing considerable individual variation in tint, in the same locality and the same month was secured by A.S. Veray east of Um Pang on the Mewong River, Siam, between February 3 and 27, probably at the time of coat-change. Some are paler grey, some darker and browner than the pale skin from Mt. Mulai-yit but they are obviously the same monkey. An unusually brilliantly-tinted skin, with a golden sheen, was collected by Vernay south-west of Kempenpet, 600 ft., on the Klong Klong River on February 27 A topo-type of <i>argenteus</i> and Tenasserim skins, but very like the palest Um Pang skin.</p> 

<p>Tickell's MS. account of <i>phayrei</i>, and his figure of a specimen shot on the ground while drinking at a stream in the hills between Kawkareick and Midiawaddee in Tenasserim, referno doubt <i>crepusculus</i>. In the living animal the face is livid purple with white rings round the eyes and white lips; the general colour is smoke- or ash-grey all over except the brow and hands and feet, which are black, and the hind abdomen and inner side of the thighs, which are white.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---It was not all common near Amherst, keeping to the depths of the forest and frequenting in small parties only the hugest trees. It was seldom seen owing to its fear of man, but might be heard crashing through the trees in full flight. When by chance observed in flight, the party was seen to keep in line, headed by the biggest, galloping along the large boughs of the trees and occasionally flinging themselves, with prodigious leaps, from one to another. The main body continues its flight for some time, but an old male will sometimes stop behind, uttering, with the mouth wide open, a short deep bark, not unlike that of the Indian Entellus. At other times they are usually silent. In flight they were never seen to carry the tail upright, like the Entellus in India.</p>

<p>Shortridge collected this monkey on the east bank of the Irrawaddy, 560 ft., opposite Kyaukmyaung; at Se-en, 1,411 ft., in the Hsipaw State; at Gokteik, 2,133 ft., at Mansam Falls and at Pyaungyaung in the North Shan State. H.C. Smith subsequently got it at Nattaung, 700 ft., in Maymyo, Mandalay District . In theis specimen and in one from Gokteik the parting on the brow is a short streak with the hairs diverging right and left. In the others it is a whorl with radiating hair, and this whorl is well defined in the immature specimen from Pyaungyaung, which is just changing its baby coat.</p>

<p>Shortridge found this monkey plentiful in the Hsipaw District and fairly abundant at Ngapyimin opposite Kyoukmyoung, where it probably occurs as a wanderer from the Shan Plateau, which at this point is not very far from the river; but he surmised that probably it is not found on the Irrawaddy below Mandalay, the country being too open. It lives in troops, is not apparently very noisy , but is shy of man. It was on living specimens that he noticed the difference between this race, then identified by Wroughton as <i>barbei</i>, and typical <i>phayrei</i> from Mt. Popa in the coloration of the orbits, adding that the difference is not observable on dried skins That is true. In most of his skins of <i>shanicus</i> the orbits appear to be coloured as in    <i>phayrei</i>.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, unknown*.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The Malay Peninsula from Johore northwards into TENASSERIM and S.W.Siam.</p> 

<p>* Martin's good description of Reid's type, a specimen exhibited in the Zoological Gardens London shows tolerably conclusively that it came from some place in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula. It was probably shipped from Singapore.</p>

<p>Resembling the typical race of <i>T. phayrei</i> in the pale hue on the mouth and round the eye, but eye not entirely enriched, the pale area being restricted to a semicircle above and on its outer side. Further distinguished by the presence of a cap of pale hair on the crown usually sharply contrasted with dark hue of the rest of the head and of the body, which is brown or blackish, without silvery sheen, but has the dorsal area usually paler than the flanks, often bronze-brown, and this tint spreads over the shoulders in front; the legs and tail are usually paler than the loins, sometimes a little, sometimes very conspicuously, and the underside is dark brownish or greyish-brown to nearly black.</p> 

<p>Fig. 42. Head of <i>Trachypithecus obscurus flavicauda</i> from the mouth of the Tavoy River, showing the pale crown and nape.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the closer kinship between this species and <i>phayrei</i>, and in my paper on the Langurs of British India in 1928 I regarded them as subspecies of the same species on the supposition that intermediate forms would be found; and it is true that skins of typical <i>obscurus</i> from the Malay Peninsula are often very like examples of <i>phayrei</i> from Upper Burma; but in Tenasserim the characteristic colouring of <i>obscurus</i>, i. e, the white cap and the pale contrasted tint of the hind legs and tail, became emphasized, and there is no indication whatever that in this district       <i>obscurus</i> blends with the southern form of <i>phayrei</i>, i. e., <i>crepusculus</i>, which also occurs there.</p>

<p>The two races here admitted as members of the British Indian fauna may be provisinally* diagnosed as follows:-</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Tail much paler than the legs, which are only           <p>[p. 140.</p>
a little paler than the loins</p>                               <p> <i>sanctorum</i> (Elliot),</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Tail approximately the same tint as the legs      <p>[p. 140.</p>
both being much paler than the loins</p>                       <p> <i>flavicauda</i> (Elliot),</p>

<p>Provisinally because Elliot did not describe the colour of the legs in <i>sanctorum</i>. He merely compared the type-specimen with a more southern darkish-legged form without mentioning any difference in the hue of these limbs.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---St. Matthew Island, so far as known.</p>

<p>Distinguished apparently from the other British Indian races by the comparatively slight contrast between the tint of the hind legs and of the loins, a feature in which it comes nearer to the typical race of <i>obscurus</i> from Selangor, Johore, etc., but differing from the latter in having the tail much paler than the legs.</p>

<p>The characters of this race are merely inferred from Elliot's untrustworthy description of it. He compared it to a race named <i>carbo</i> by Thomas in 1909, which inhabits Terutau Island, off the western coast of the Malay Peninsula, and is a blackish form with the legs and tail approximately matching and not very sharply contrasted with the loins. From this he distinguished the type of <i>sanctorum</i> by its creamy-white cap and buff-grey tail. If his description is correct, <i>sanctorum</i> is distinguished from the next race by the sharp contrast in colour between the tail and the hind legs. The uncertainty about <i>sanctorum</i> is particularly unfortunate because the name has page priority over the name of the next race, which is well known.</p>

<p>* I have seen the type of <i>smithi</i>, not the type <i>flavicauda</i>; but the examination of a large number of skins from the northern portion of the Malay Peninsula convinces me that the alleged differences between them are merely individual, not racial. The supposed race <i>corox</i> was based on several specimens darker in hue both above and below than typical <i>flavicauda</i>, and regarded as representing the most northern race of <i>T. obscurus</i>. But since describing it I have received from Mr. H.C. Smith a skin from the mouth of the Tavoy River, a locality to the north of the type-locality of <i>corox</i> and this skin is of the <i>flavicauda</i> type. Since a distinct subspecies is not likely to cut into the area of <i>flavicauda</i>, I abandon, for the present at all events, the idea that <i>corox</i> is a distinguishable form.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---From the northern part of the Malay Peninsula northward through TENASSERIM to Tavoy and to the Pechburi district of S.W.Siam.</p> 

<p>Distinguished from typical <i>obscurus</i> from the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula and from others found in the islands off the coast by the strong contrast between the pale whitish or greyish tail and hind legs from the hips to the ankles and the dark brownish or blackish hue of the rest of the dorsal surface up to head, which has the typical pale, often silvery, conspicuous cap. From Elliot's description of <i>sanctorum</i> it differs from that form by legs being pale, like the tail, not brownish, and contrasted with it.</p>

<p>This Leaf-Monkey is represented in British Museum by skins from the following British Indian localities: Bankachon near Victoria Point, Tenasserim Town, Banlaw on the Great Tenasserim River (Shortridge), King Island, Mergui Archipelago (Pilgrim), and Tavoy (H.C. Simith).</p>

<p>A series of nine skins from Bankachon, December and January, shows considerable individual variations in details. The cap is usually silvery and conspicuous, sometimes soiled yellowish, sometimes quite inconspicuous; the back is mostly black or blackish, with a varying amount of bronze-brown or grey-brown on the shoulders; the arms vary from decidedly brown, only a little lighter than the shoulders, to pale, glistening, buffy-whitish or grey almost to the wrist, and nearly as pale as the legs; the legs, mostly clear whitish, may be ashy or pale smoke-grey; the tail may match or be contrasted with the legs, and is whitish or ash-grey or decidedly yellowish throughout, or ashy-grey in its proximal, smoke-grey in its distal half. Individual skins of this series closely match skins from localities in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p>The proximity of St. Matthew Island, Mergui, to Victoria Point suggests the likelihood of identity between the Leaf-Monkeys of the two areas; but the description of <i>sanctorum</i> does not admit that determination, especially as Elliot referred a specimen from James Island, a few miles to the north, to <i>flavicauda</i>. This skin Kloss assigned to <i>smithi</i>, as also a skin from Kissaraing Island. The skin in the British Museum from King Island (September), as well as those from Tenasserim Town (March) and Banlaw (April), have the hairs of the belly darker, blackish when massed, than in the skins from Bankachon, in which they are paler, palish brown when massed; but the skin from Tavoy is like the Bankachon set.</p>   

<p>A flat native imperfect skin from near Pechburi, S. W. Siam (K. G. Gairdner), seems to agree best with Tenasserim Town and Banlaw skins.</p>

<p>According to Shortridge this Leaf-Monkey is almost as plentiful in the localities where he collected it as the White-handed Gibbon (<i>Hylobates lar</i>), but is much less noisy. The alarm-note is almost like that of a Macaque, and quite unlike the curious ``hoot'' of the Indian Langurs. It keeps to the thickest jungles and is rather shy of man.</p>

Nwalabo in Tavoy (Davison), April, has the long hairs over the ears,on the nape, upper arm, and on the leg to a less extent, with silvery sheen at the tip; there is also some silvery spangling on the shoulders and back and a good deal of ashy-grey on the chest. In this {\female} there is only the merest trace of yellow hair detectable about the callosities in the badly made up skin; but in a {\female} from Menam Hoi, S.W. Siam (K.G. Gairdner), there is a visible patch of scanty hair below the callosities. In the type the eyelids are cut away, but in the skins from Nawlaboo, Menam  Hoi, and two from Sai Yoke,  S.W. Siam (K.G. Gairdner), the eyelids have a lived, yellowish hue.</p>

<p>* This locality is the same as that originally assigned to <i>barbei</i> by Blyth, and the monkey agrees tolerably well with the one he described as <i>barbei</i> in 1863, when he corrected the locality to the Tipperah Hills, but it does not agree with the one described in 1847.</p>

<p>I suspect Blyth may have had in his hands a specimens or specimens of this monkey from the Ye District when, in 1863, he redescribed <i>barbei</i> and said it came from Tipperah. Also I think there is little doubt that the specimen from Mt. Mulai-yit assigned by Anderson to <i>barbei</i> represented it. Its affinities always have been a puzzle. I now think it is more nearly related to  <i>T. pyrrhus cristatus</i>, which extends into the Malay Peninsula, than to the more northern species <i>T. phayrei</i>; that it is, in fact, the most northern representative, apart perhaps from <i>T. pyrrhus germani</i> of Siam and Cochin China, of <i>T. pyrrhus</i> rather than one of the most southern  representatives of <i>T. phayrei</i>, But although it is an isolated form, not, so far as is yet known, intergrading either with <i>cristatus</i> or <i>germani</i>, I provisionally regard it as a distinct race of <i>pyrrhus</i>. One circumstance connected with it stands out quite clearly. Living almost alongside each other in Tenasserim and keeping absolutely apart, and entirely distinct from each other in colour, are the three Leaf-Monkeys <i>T. phayrei crepusculus, T. obscurus flavicauda</i>, and <i>T. pyrrhus atrior</i>. A fourth species coming into the same area is <i>Presbytis femoralis keatii</i> (see p. 161), which, according to the present conception of  <i>atrior</i>, is, like it, a migrant from the south.</p>

<p>Fig. 44.---skull of adult {\male} of <i>Kasi senex nestor</i> from Pandura, showing the sloped brow and more prominent angular portion of the mandible, by which the skull of this species may be distinguished usually from that of <i>Semnopithecus entellus thersites</i>. &#x00D7; &#x2154;.</p>

<p>Distinguished from  <i>Trachypithecus</i> by the newly-born young being black or very light silvery-grey with white cheeks, and by the hairs of the sacral area (croup) being shorter than those of the fore-back. As in the type of <i>Trachypithecus</i>, namely, <i>pyrrhus</i>, the sexes differ a little in colour, the {\female} having a distinct patch of white hair below the callosities and sometimes spreading to a varying on to the base of the thigh.</p>

<p>The principal differences between the two species here admitted may be summarized as follows:-</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Hairs of the cheeks typically tolerably uniformly 
              brown and nearly matching those of the crown,
              never white at the base on each side of the face;
              throat and chin darker than the crown; end of     <p>[p. 147.</p>
              the tail black.</p>                         <p> <i>johnii</i> (Fisch.),</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Hairs of the cheeks generally whitish throughout  
              and contrasted with crown, always white at
              the base close to the face; throat and chin
              whitish or white and paler than the crown;  <p>[p.150.</p>
              end of the tail lighter than the rest.</p>   <p> <i>senex</i> (Erxl.),</p>

<p>*In 1928, when I asssociated this monkey and its Ceylonese allies. in the same group as the <i>entellus</i>-like Langurs, although giving them specific
rank as <i>P. senex</i> and <i>P. entellus</i> respectively, the obvious course to follow was to regard the comparatively trivial differences between <i>johni</i> and <i>senex</i> as of subspecific value to avoid suggesting their equivalence to the much greater differences between either of these forms and  <i>entellus</i>. But now the <i>entellus</i> and <i>senex</i> <i>johnii</i> are regarded as distinct genera, I agree with Hill that specific rank may be given to <i>johnii</i>, which, although very obviously closely allied to <i>senex</i>, does not actually intergrade with it.</p>

<p>General colour of the body limbs and tail to the apex, jet black above and below, but the dorsal surface typically shows a faint pale speckle under reflected light and frequently there is a conspicuous grizzled patch on the loins, whence it spreads on to the extreme root of the tail and the upper part of the thighs; this patch varies greatly in distinctness and may be undetectable; head with a black brow-band, but the rest of the crown brown or buffy-brown, this tint spreading on to the nape; the long cheek-hairs also brown, generally a little darker than the crown but the hairs black close the face and on the chin; the throat with dark blackish-brown hair, darker than the crown.</p>

<p>McCann recorded several wild-caught specimens in which the end of the the tail was broken off, his larger {\male} from Kodaikanal being an instance. No doubt Kinloch's large {\male} had the same defect.</p>

<p>The skulls differ profoundly individually both in the degree of prognathism, which affects the slope of the facial plane, and in the length of the cranial. This is shown by the differences between the two skulls from Kotengady and Anamaad. The latter, an older skull, has a shorter, more vertical face and a very short back behind the auditory orifice. The length and width of the cranial portion of the two is as follows:---Kotengady, 83&#x00D7;60; Anamaad, 74&#x00D7;60 mm. Others are intermediate. The mandibles also differ. In the Anamaad skull the postdental portion has the hind border strongly convex in its lower half and no inferior emargination, whereas in the Brahmagiri Hills skull the postdental portion has the hind border much less convex and lower border emarginate below. (For the dimensions of these skulls see p. 157.)</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---In Coorg, according to Shortridge, this monkey is apparently confined to the southern slopes of the Brahmagiri Hills on the Wynaad border, where it occurs in the ``sholas'' or patches of jungle surrounded by grass country on the mountain sides. In this district, which he thinks is probably its northern limits Shortridge recorded the species from 2,700 to 5,135 ft. It is eaten by the jungle tribes, who use its skin to make drums.</p>

<p>On the label of a specimen collected on the Colengody Estate, Cochin, 3,500 ft., Ryley O'Brien wrote: ``common, but very wideawake and difficult to get a shot at.'' At Anamaad in S. Malabar he secured the species at 3,200 ft.</p>

<p>Kinloch in 1923 described this species as formerly extremely common in the evergreen forest on the Nelliampathy Hills, where its noisy cry, ``hoo-ha, hoo-ha, hoo,'' could be heard in every direction all day long; but its numbers are now greatly reduced owing to persecution by the jungle Mulcers and Kadars and coffee-estate coolies, who are inordinately fond of its flesh. He recorded its altitude in these hills as 3,500 ft.</p>

<p>Confirming and extending these observations, McCann (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxxvi, p. 624, 1934) states that the species occurs at the foot of the Tinnevelly Hills, but in the Palnis is not found below 3,000 ft. Here it frequents dense ``sholas'' and may often be noticed passing from one to another over the intervening open green stretches. Occasionally a solitary male much scarred from fighting with a probably successful rival, may be seen, but more usually pairs or small companies. In the morning they are fond of sunning themselves in the tallest eucalyptus trees near the ``sholas,'' but the afternoon is spent in sound sleep. When cornered in a tree, the monkey frequently drops to the ground and attempts to escape by running on all fours at a good pace. The natives, who  highly prize the flesh, blood, and gall as cures for all diseases, use dogs to locate them, and are attracted to the spot by the barking of the monkey at its pursuers. At Kukkal Shola, in the Palni Hills, McCann secured a {\female} at 6,100 ft.</p>

<p>According to Hill the roar of the {\male} is like that of the Ceylonese Bear-Monkey (<i>K.senax monticola</i>). Other sounds are a short, sharp growl and a whining cry, the latter used more by the {\female} and young.</p>

<p>McCann's discovery at Kodaikanal of a {\female} with a full-time foetus on May 8 and of very young specimens on December 20 and 29 suggests that there is no definite breeding season.</p>

<p>General colour of the body and limbs varying from black to brown, the crown of the head and nape darker or lighter brown, usually paler than the shoulders and back, but the long whiskers directed back over the ears typically white and contrasted with the crown, sometimes pale brown at the ends, but always white at the base close to the black face; the throat and chin white or whitish, like the whiskers, and paler than the crown; the distal end of the tail becoming gradually paler to a varying extent.</p>

<p>Typical specimens of the four intergrading races of this species may be distinguished as follows:---</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Crown and croup sharply contrasted by their

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Crown and croup less contrasted by their
              paler hue, sometimes scarcely at all, from the 
              generally brown hue of the shoulders and back; 
              distal end of the tail less extensively pale.</p>   <p>[p.154.</p>

<p>Reasons for the adoption of this name are given on p. 154 (footnote). Another name that has been used for these Ceylon monkeys, even as lately as 1918 by Wroughton, is <i>veter</i> I inn., 1766, based upon a monkey described by Ray in 1793 as ``white, with black beard'' (? whiskers), and alleged to have come from Ceylon. No doubt Ray was told it was from Ceylon; but from the evidence of the description, by which one must abide, it did not, since no Ceylonese monkey has a black beard or whiskers. That is the reason why Blanford (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1877, p. 622), quite rightly, rejected it, and why it was not considered either by Hinton or myself. But in 1934 Hill said <i>veter</i> was the earliest name given to the ``Purple-faced Monkey'' of Ceylon. If so, it would have to come in for one of the races, as Wroughton, who like Hill, preferred the alleged locality to the description, perceived. But Hill rejected it, not because of the ``black whiskers,'' but because of the white body of the type, being unable to determine to which of the three races addicted to albinism the name applied. Now <i>veter</i>, which is not a <i>nomen nudum</i>, as Hill declared, is the type of <i>Pithecus</i>; and if assignable to the Purple-faced Monkey, as claimed, Hill should have taken <i>Pithecus</i>, not <i>Kasi</i>, as the generic name. Another name for this species, cited by Hill, and no doubt copied from Elliot or Forbes,</p>

There is, however, a paragraph reading ``<i>Simia silenus</i> y alba; barba nigra,'' followed by a reference to <i>Simia veter</i> Linn. But from the context it is perfectly clear that ``alba'' is the first word of the of the description, not a systematic name.</p>

<p>The individual variation in size in both sexes is considerable, I have assumed that the smallest {\male} and {\female} from Matara recorded by Hill are adult. It is curious that their three dimensions are exactly the same! The tail may be from about 4 to 10 in. longer than the head and body.</p>

<p>According to Hill and Phillips this race is restricted to the wettest part of the lowlands on the south-west and south of the island between the coast and the mountains, where the average rainfall is from 75 to 200 inches per annum owing to the south-west monsoon, thus resembling the Malabar tract of India, where the equally black Leaf-Monkey (<i>K.johnii</i>) occurs. In the Udugama Hills it ascends to 3,000 ft.</p>

<p>It is generally found in the forests, wandering about in the tree-tops in troops consisting of 30 or 40 individuals of both sexes and all ages; but in the smaller jungles and near villages the troops are only up to ten or a dozen in number. In broken ground it may be seen clambering about the boulders. In places where it is left unmolested it is comparatively fearless; but where it is shot for food or its skins it becomes timid and goes crashing away with prodigious leaps through the forests of hides in the foliage at the approach of man. It feeds upon leaves, fruits, flowers, fern-fronds, and seeds, possibly, also, to a certain extent on tree-frogs, since a young one in captivity ate them them with avidity. It characteristic cry is a loud oft-repeated ``hooh! hooh! hooh!'' heard in the early mornings, but a shrill shriek or bird-like twittering is also uttered.</p>

<p>*At least in my skins. According to Phillips the tail becomes reddish-brown towards the tip.</p>

<p>No special breeding season is known, but the young are apparently born mostly in February and March.</p>

<p>According to these dimensions females are at least as large as males. Hill's largest {\male} from Kottawa has an exceptionally about short tail. It died in captivity, and if the tail-measurements is accurately recorded it seems probable that the organ was imperfect, as is often the case in captive monkeys. Phillips recorded the weight of a large captive {\male} as 8&#xBD; 1b., the average of 2 {\male} {\male} as 7&#xBD;.,and the weight of a small captive {\male} as just under 7 1b.</p>

<p>The range of this monkey is the low-country wet zone north of the Kaluganga, which separates it from <i>vetulus</i>, where the average annual rainfall is typically from 75 to 100 in., but reaches 200 in. in the foothills. On the coast it occurs at least as far as Colombo, but inland it ranges still farther to the north.</p>

<p>So far as in known its habits do not differ from those of <i>vetulus</i>.</p>

<p>Locality of <i>type</i> (nor preserved) of <i>senex</i> ``hills of southern Ceylon''; of <i>albinus</i>, Matale, C.P.; of <i>Kasi vetulus philbricki</i>,  Kantalai, E.P., near Trincomalee.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The hills east of Matale and Madulkelle up to 5,000 ft.; also the low-country dry zone of the N.C.P.,  N.W.P., E.P., and c.p., ``right across the Island in its northern lowland portion south of lat. 8&#xB0; 30&#2032; , from Marich-chukkaddi on the west to Nilaveli on the east coast'' (Hill).</p>

<p>* The name <i>senex</i>, although admitted as valid by all authors, was discarded by Hill in 1934 as a <i>nomen nudum</i>, which it certainly is not, since it was given to monkeys from the hills of Ceylon described by knox as ``milk white.'' Hill's real reason apparently was its ascription to abnormally coloured individuals; and for the same reason, with which no systematist will agree, he rejected <i>albinus</i> Kelaart, usually, if not always, regarded as a synonym of <i>senex</i>. When dealing with <i>philbricki</i> in his monograph of these monkeys in 1934, he said that since Kelaart's white monkey          (<i>albinus</i>) came from Matale it was undoubtedly an albinistic specimen of <i>philbricki</i>, and that those seen, and described, by Robert Knox were probably also of this type. I entirely agree, and can see no escape from the dropping of <i>philbricki</i> as a synonym of <i>albinus</i>, since <i>philbricki</i>, and no other race, occurs near Matale and is known from Phillips's records to be liable to albinism, at least at Gammaduwa. Also I see no valid reason for dissenting from the traditional identification of  <i>albinus</i> with <i>senex</i>, which, as the oldest name, has to be assigned, even arbitrarily if necessary, to one of the races of this Ceylonese species. Hill has done a great service by showing to which it belongs. I may add that when Phillips described <i>philbricki</i>, which was unknown to me when I published my paper in 1928, he was not aware of its occurrence in the hills by Matale, the type-locality of <i>albinus</i>.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>vetulus</i> and resembling <i>nestor</i> in the generally brown hue of the dorsal surface, but differing from the latter at least typically, by the comparative inconspicuousness of the rump-patch, which is only a little lighter than than the area in front of it. It is also larger than <i>nestor</i> and than <i>vetulus</i>, on the average, in all its flesh-dimensions.</p>

<p>The only skins of this race that I have seen are three from Kantalai, including the type, presented by the Colombo Museum, which have the rump-patch comparatively inconspicuous, and two unmeasured skins from Kala Oya, N.C.P., presented by Sir F Colyer. These have the rump-patch to all intents and purposes as well defined as in <i>nestor</i>, and I should have assigned them to that race but for Hills's record of ``<i>philbricki</i>'' from Kala Oya in 1936, based on seven specimens.But his measurements of Kala Oya specimens suggests that they are on the average rather smaller than typical members of this race. No doubt Kala Oya is one of the localities where the two races blend. In 1936 he summarized the characters of the race by saying that it ``is distinguished mainly by its large size and very long white-tipped tail. The rest of its characters overlap those of other races.'' In none of my skins is the tail white-tipped. The extreme end is pale tawny, the pale area being less white and less extensive than in <i>vetulus</i> and <i>nestor</i>.</p>

<p>The weight is variable. Phillips recorded a young {\male}, from an unstated locality, as 22 1b., and reasonably surmised that an adult {\male} would scale 25 1b. But Hill's heaviest {\male} from Kala Oya was about 16 1b., 2 {\female} {\female} from the same locality were about 15&#xBE; 1b. and 9&#xBD; 1b . respectively, and 4 adult {\male} {\male} from Palonnaruwa were about 13&#xBC; 1b. each. </p>

<p>This race is the only one of the four that inhabits the same area of Ceylon as the Langur (<i>S. entellus thersites</i>). As indicated above, it has a wide and varied range. According to Phillips it spends much of its time sitting high up in the branches of leafless trees or climbing leisurely from bough to bough. In the lowland jungles those he encountered had little fear of man; but in the hills and jungles at Gammaduwa and elsewhere, where it has been hunted for its flesh and skin, it is very wary and shy.</p>

<p>Of this race sometimes called the Bear-Monkey, from an example of it being mistaken by Major Forbes for a Sloth-Bear the British Museum has a skin in poor condition received from Kelaart, one from Hakgalla, 6,210 ft., one from Pattipola, 6,200 ft. (E.W Mayor), and from Adam;s Peak (S. B. Bell) without record of altitude. This is blacker than the last two. Kelaart got his type from 6,185 ft. in Nuwara Eliya, and Hill recorded a specimen from the Elk Plains, 6,000 ft.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Phillips's largest {\female} has exactly the same dimensions as Hill's {\male} from Bogawantalawa. They were probably taken from the same specimen, differently sexed by the authors.</p>

<p>According to Phillips's this monkey is now found only in the jungles of the high mountain ridges and in the forests around Hakgalla, the Bopats and Horton, Moon and Elk Plains.</p>

<p>Owing to the persecution to which it has been subjected, largely for its luxuriantly coated skin, it is not only extremely timid of man, but is in some danger of extermination. It has already been killed out in certain districts where it was formerly known, and is rare in localities where it still survives. Its habits are the same as those of the other races. It lives in troops among the tree-tops, and on the approach of man either retreats precipitately through the forest or hides in the foliage concealed by its sombre hue, its white whiskers blending with the clumps of lichens growing on the branches. Soon after dawn, especially in the north-east monsoon, its presence in troops is indicated by its loud cry ``hooh! hooh! hooh!'' echoing across the valleys from the high jungles (Phillips).</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>mitrata</i> Esch. (<i>&#x207C; Simia aygula</i> Linn.; see Thomas, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1911, p. 128).</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---From TENASSERIM and S. W. Siam, south-eastwards to Borneo.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>Trachypithecus</i> and <i>Kasi</i> by the sum of a number of characters of which one or more may fail when when all the species of the genus are considered, but which hold good, so far as is known, in the case of the British Indian species of the two genera.</p>

<p>The newly-born young is of the ``cruciger'' type, the general whiteness of the colour being relieved by a dark spinal stripe. whence on the shoulders a dark stripe extends on each side to the arms. In the adult the inner side of the thigh is conspicuously white and sharply marked off from the darker hue of the outer surface.</p>

<p>In the adult {\female} the perin{\ae}um is comparatively long, as long as the vulva, which is situated lower down between the callosities; the clitoris does not lie between the labia of the vulva, but is external to it, below and sunk in a small pit in the centre of a rounded swelling which projects below the callosities*.</p>

<p>The skulls of both genera are subject to a good deal of individual variation, but on the average the cranium of <i>Presbytis</i> is less sharply constricted behind the orbits, has the occipital region more inflated, with a weaker crest, the brow-ridges weaker, with the upper edge of the orbits straighter, less arched giving a ``frowning'' aspect to the brow, the nasal bones prominently convex, the anterior nares broader below, less elongated, the muzzle more abbreviated, and there is a well-marked emargination where the zygomatic arches join the maxill{\ae}; the mandible finally is not robust, especially in its postdental portion. (See also Shortridge's note on the appearance of the face in the only British Indian representative of <i>Presbytis</i>, recorded on p. 163.)</p>

<p>Hair of the forehead typically parted by a pair of whorls from 20 to 24 mm. behind the brow, rising into an erect crest between them and projecting forwards as a long fringe over the brow and forming a high, thick tuft or crest on the crown. Colour of the upper side varying from very dark brown back or  whitish and sharply contrasted with it; the underside similarly varies from brown to white, but the underside of the tail is always dark, hardly paler than the upper side, and never strongly contrasted with it; the limbs externally become blackish towards the hands and feet, but the inner side of the arm may be whitish from the axilla to the elbow, and the inner side of the thigh is always white and sharply defined from the dark outer side, the white frequently extending as a narrow stripe between the knee and heel. The face is black with the lips flesh-coloured and clothed with white hair, and the eyelids are also to a certain extent pale.</p>

<p>Fig. 48.---Head of <i>Presbytis femoralis keatii</i> from Malewoon, Tenasserim.</p>

<p>As I recorded in 1934, two partially albino examples of this race were collected in the Malay Peninsula. One of them, from Trang, the type-locality of <i>keatii</i>, Thomas described as a distinct species, <i>P. robinsoni</i>. It is mostly covered with a mixture of grey and white hairs above, but has the hands and feet dark brown and the end of the tail greyish-brown. The other, taken at Bandon, in association with typical <i>keatii</i>, is even paler, being mostly creamy-white, with the hands and feet pale buff-brown, darkening on the fingers and toes. Not improbably similar mutants will be found in Tenasserim</p>

<p>Flesh-measurements (in English inches) of two typically coloured examples, collected by Shortridge in Tenasserim are as follows:---</p>

<p>Malewoon, ad. {\male}: head and body 22&#x2156;; tail 31&#x2156;; hind foot 7&#x2155;.</p>

<p>Bankachon, ad. {\female}: head and body 22&#x2155; tail 32&#x2158;; hind foot 7&#x2155;.</p>

<p>The weight of the {\male} was 15&#xBD; 1b., of the {\female} 14&#xBD; 1b.</p>

<p>The equality in size of the body measurements between the sexes is borne out by the skulls as the following dimensions (in mm.) show:---</p>

<p>The largest known skull, that of an adult {\male} from west of Bangkok, in Siam, has a total length of 101 mm. and a Condylobasal length of 82 mm.</p>

<p>Next to nothing of the habits of this Leaf-Monkey has been noted, but they probably differ in no respect from those of other species of the family. The large male from Siam, west of Bangkok, was said by its collector, K. G. Gairdner, to represent a purely mountain form; but the specimens collected by Shortridge came from comparatively low levels in Tenasserim, where it is ``apparently not at all plentiful and rather shy. ''On freshly-killed specimens Shortridge observed that the ``facial area is very small and quite unlike that of Burmese and Indian Langurs. The mouth is pinkish-white, but the orbits are dusky flesh-coloured and not a conspicuous feature.''</p>

<p>Suborder <b> <i>LEMUROIDEA</i>.</b> </p>

<p>Distinguished from the PITHECOIDEA (p. 14) by retaining the <i>rhinarium</i>, or moist area of naked skin round the nostrils, with its extension as a narrow strip, or <i>philtrum</i>, to the edge of the upper lip dividing it into a right and left portion and by the adherence of the lip in the middle to the gum so that it is not protrusible. The hands and feet have the fourth digit never shorter than the third in almost all cases longer. and the second digit of the foot is armed with a distinct claw, quite different from the flat nail of the rest of the digits. The tongue has a well-developed, underlying lamina, with serrated free end, the <i>sublingua</i>.</p>

<p>The skull has the orbit communicating with temporal fossa there being no bony partition between the two. The lower canine is reduced in size, incisiform, and projects forwards alongside the similarly projecting incisors, the six teeth combining to form a comb-like structure, and the two median upper incisors are separated by a distinct space.</p>

<p>The LEMUROIDEA and the Suborder CHIROMYOIDEA, containing the aberrant <i>Aye-Aye (Chiromys or Daubentonia)</i>, which has rodent-like dentition and other peculiarities, constitute the Strepsirhine division of the Primates, distinguished from the Haplorhine division, containing the TARSIOIDEA and PITHECOIDEA, by the structure of the nose and the non-protrusible upper lip, by the absence of the postorbital partition in the skull, and by the peculiar arrangement of the lower incisors and canines. These teeth act as a comb for scraping the fur and skin, and the function of the sublingua is the removal of particles from the teeth. The claw on the second digit of the foot also acts as a scratcher and cleaner of the fur.</p>

<p>The Asiatic LEMUROIDEA belong to a single family.</p>

<p> <b>Family LORISID{\AE}</b>.</p>

<p>Distinguished from the families Lemurid{\AE} and Indrisid{\AE}, which inhabit Madagascar, by the tympanic bone being large and external to the bulla, of which it forms the outer wall, not small annuliform and enclosed within it. Also by the clitoris being traversed throughout by the urethral canal, which opens at its tip, instead of openly grooved behind, with the orifice of the urethra at its base.</p>

<p>The tail is very short or absent. The hands and feet have the first digit (pollex and hallux) relatively very large and capable of considerable backward extension; the second digit is abbreviated, the remaining three being strong, these features, associated with a short, broad, well-padded palm and sole and short hairy heel, combining to give a tenacity of grip unequalled in other families of Primates.</p>

<p>Mamm{\ae} 4, tolerably widely spaced on the hinder part of the chest and the fore part of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The skull has the muzzle moderately elongated, with its upper and lower edges nearly parallel and the anterior nares terminal; the orbits are expanded, with thickened rims, the cranium has a pair of strong temporal ridges, which only occasionally coalesce, and the occiput does not project far beyond the condyles. The dental formula is <i>i</i>. &#x00B2;/&#x00B2;, <i>c</i>.#x00B9;/#x00B9;, <i>pm</i>. &#x00B3;/&#x00B3;, <i>m</i>. &#x00B3;/&#x00B3;; the first lower premolar is large and canine-like, closing behind the upper canine.</p>

<p>Slow Loris (<i>Nycticebus coucang</i>).</p>
<p>Slender Loris (<i>Loris tardigradus</i>).</p>

<p>To this family also belong the two genera of African Pottos (<i>Perodicticus</i> and <i>Arctocebus</i>), distinguished from the Asiatic by, among other characters almost complete suppression of the second digit of the hand. A closely related family is the Galagid{\ae}, comprising the African Galagos, which have the tail and the heel very ling, in conformity with prodigious leaping capacity, in great contrast to the the complete inability to leap exhibited by y the Lorises and Pottos.</p>

<p>The two Asiatic genera may be briefly diagnosed as follows:--</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Ears small, limbs stout, tail prominent;
              skull with shorter snout and palate,    <p>[E. Geoffr., p. 165.</p>
              orbits, etc.</p>                      <p>NYCTICEBUS</p>

<p> <i>b</i>. Ears moderately large limbs very slender,
              tail typically suppressed externally; skull
              with elongated snout and palate, broader           <p>[p. 174.</p>
              orbits. etc.</p>                  <p>LORIS E. Geoffr.,</p>
              
<p>Genus <b>NYCTICEBUS</b> E. Geoffroy.</p>

<p> <i>Nycticebus</i>, E. Geoffroy, Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, xix, p. 162, 1812; and of subsequent authors.</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>bengalensis</i> E. Geoffroy.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---S. E. Asia from N. E. BENGAL, ASSAM, UPPER BURMA, and Laos southward to Annam, the Malay Peninsula, and through the Sunda Islands to Borneo.</p>

<p>Body robust; limbs stout, with powerful hands and feet and thick digits; head rounded, the muzzle rounded, with the upper jaw and nose not very noticeably projecting beyond the lower jaw; ears reduced, nearly concealed in the fur, the margin rounded, the supratragus valvuar and surmounted by a small supplementary ridge and small pocket-like submarginal depression just above the position of the suppressed antitragus; tail always present, but conical and short, from &#xBD; to 1 in. long. Skull with interorbital septum moderately broad; orbits expanded, but not so wide across as the zygomatic arches; the nasals and premaxill{\ae} only slightly produced beyond the level of the upper incisors; the palate not prolonged beyond the level of the last molars, and the median upper incisors larger than the laterals, which may be absent.</p>

<p>Until 1902 the Slow Lorises were cited by all writers except a few of early date, <i>Nycticebus tardigradus</i>. But in that year Stone and Rehn (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philad. 1v, p. 141) pointed out that the name <i>tardigradus</i> Linn. belongs to the Slow Loris of Ceylon. They substituted <i>coucang</i> Bodd. for the Slow Loris, admitting a considerable number of local races, which, with many others subsequently described, were cited as ``species'' or ``subspecies,'' according to the fancy of authors. But there is abundant evidence, in my opinion, that many of these so-called ``species'' or ``subspecies,''were based on purely individual differences, often due to seasonal changes in the coat and colour, and I here adopt the conclusion that there there is but one species of <i>Nycticebus</i>, for which the oldest known name is <i>coucang</i>.</p>

<p> <b>19. Nycticebus coucang</b> (Boddaert).</p>

<p> <i>Tardigradus coucang</i>, Boddaert, Elench. Anim. p. 67, 1785 (Tardigradus preocc.). (For other references and synonymies, see under the subsepecific headings.)</p>

<p>Coat, in good condition, consisting of copies underwool and abundance of longer, stiffer, but soft contour hairs. General colour very variable, but the back, in good coat, always ornamented with a conspicuous dark spinal stripe extending sometimes from the root of the tail and reaching the crown, where it may be narrow and cease or broad and branched, and extend laterally to the ears and eyes. the areas around those organs being always darkish-tinted; the forehead in the middle line, the interocular area, and the muzzle always white; the cheeks and temples paler than the crown, sometimes white. When these white areas and the dark stripes to the eyes and ears are well defined they constitute a characteristic facial pattern or ``mask.'' But sometimes the extension of the white areas over the crown obliterates the stripes, leaving the whole head pale, except for the tinted areas round the eyes and ears and the median stripe on the crown, and every stage in the development and obliteration of the darker markings may be traced.</p>

<p>The three British Indian races of the Slow Loris here admitted may be briefly distinguished as follows:---</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Head and neck pale, mostly whitish or grey, the
				median stripe on the nape and crown narrow,
				with at most faint stripes to the eyes and ears.</p>

<p> <i>1'a</i>.Stripe ceasing on the middle of the crown,
				cut off from the coloured areas round the        <p>[(Fischer), p. 166.</p>
				eyes and ears; size larger<p>                   <p> <i>bengalensis</i> </p>

<p> <i>\'b</i>.Stripe typically bifurcating and passing to
				the eyes stripes from ears nearly reaching       <p>[Elliot, p. 169.</p>
				the point of bifurcation; a little smaller</p>   <p> <i>tenasserimensis</i> </p>

<p> <i>b</i>. Head and neck mostly well coloured the stripe
				board on the nape and crown and extended
				broadly forwards to the eyes and laterally
				to the ears; general colour brighter and size       <p>[p. 171.</p>
				still smaller</p>                              <p> <i>coucang</i> (Bodd.),</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> of <i>bengalensis</i>, Bengal; of <i>cinereus</i>, Bangkok; of <i>incanus</i>, Kyeikpadein, Pegu.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---ASSAM*. TIPPERAH, CHITTAGONG, UPPER and LOWER BURMA, Siam, Laos, and Annam.</p>

<p>Distinguished by its larger size and pale head, the median stripe ceasing in the centre of the crown and not extended forwards or laterally to join the coloured areas round the eyes and ears; at most faint, abbreviated stripes extending upwards from those areas towards it.</p>

<p>General colour vary variable. Head, nape and usually at least the fore part of the shoulders white, cream or grey, except for the median brown stripe, which ceases in the middle of the crown, and for faint strips from the eyes and ears, which never meet the median stripe. Spinal stripe broad or narrow, varying from blackish-brown to ochreous-brown, sometimes traceable to the rump, sometimes nt beyond the middle of the back, commonly more or less emphasized anteriorly by grey or silvery hairs continued from those of the shoulder. Flanks and back varying from sepia-brown through all shades to ochreous, buffy or dark grey. Arms to elbow varying with the tint of the shoulder from brownish to whitish, below elbow to hand typically paler, whitish; legs varying from brown to nearly white; hands and feet always quite pale. Lower side varying from whitish to ashy-grey or pale buff. The wool of the dorsal side slaty at base.</p>

<p>In a large series of skins ranging from the Naga Hills to Lower Pegu and thence eastward to Siam, Laos, and Annam no two are exactly alike, even from the same district, the variations in colour being mainly due to the condition of the coat, whether fresh or faded, and especially to the presence or absence of the contour hairs, which when moulted leave the coat entirely woolly and when abundant give a silvery sheen to the back, particularly alongside the dark spinal stripe, which they throw into strong relief.</p>

<p>*Annandale (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1908. pp, 888-9) recorded, on the evidence of La Touche, the existence in the Lushai Hills of a Lemur he considered to be underscribed because it had a bushy tail; and in support of his belief he published a photograph of the animal suspended. Sloth-fashion, from a branch. The photograph clearly represents a typical example of <i>N. coucang bengalensis</i>. A bushy tail up to an inch n length, not including the terminal hairs, is a well-known feature in <i>Nycticebus</i>.</p>

<p>Vosmaer's figure and description of the type show that the general colour was ``grey or clear ashy-yellowish,'' a little richer and more ochreous on the flanks and thighs. Two skins from the Naga Hills are better coloured, the whole of the upper side behind the shoulders, apart from some grey hairs alongside the spinal stripe, being pale ochreous-brown. One of them labelled ``Naga Hills,'' has the abdomen buffy or pale brown in the middle, whereas the other, labelled `` Champang,'' which is a little brighter on the flanks and rump, has the abdomen mainly whitish. A skin from Bassein in Lower Pegu (November 22) closely matches those from the Naga Hills, but has the flanks paler, thus approaching the type of <i>bengalensis</i>, and one from Kindat, on the east bank of the Chindwin (December), differs from the skin from the Naga Hills in having the nape and shoulders ashy, the flanks and rump brown. These skins are in good coat, but in one taken 50 miles north of Pegu (June) the coat is all woolly without contour hairs, the whole of the back being ochreous or buffy, without silvering, the arms and legs paler and the belly pale buff. The type of <i>incanus</i>, from Kyeikpadein, Pegu (August) is, on the other hand, mostly grey, with no ochreous or brown except a little on the rump, the arms legs and underside being ashy, but there is some silvery-grey on the head and alongside the spinal stripe.</p>

<p>The type of <i>cinereus</i>, from Bangkok, was described as clear ashy-grey mixed with golden-brown on the back and rump; but a co-type in the British Museum is in moult, and is mostly covered with soiled grey wool, but some ochreous-brown new hair erupting in patches on the flanks suggests that the skin would have resembled those from the Naga Hills when the coat was fresh. A skin from Taungyi in Thaton closely matches this co-type of <i>cinereus</i>. Anderson identified as <i>N. tardigradus</i> var. <i>cinerea</i> skins from Goalpara in Assam, from Tipperah, and from the Kakhyen Hills east of Bhamo. A skin from Xien Quang Koo, Laos, named <i>bengalensis</i> by Thomas, was determined by Osgood as <i>bengalensis cinereus</i>; and a much more extensively grey skin from Lao Ba in Annam was referred by both these authors to <i>cinereus</i>. I am unable to find any reliable character by which <i>cinereus</i> can be distinguished from <i>bengalensis</i>.</p>

<p>The skull is the largest of the genus, with the condylobase exceeding 60 mm. In the co-type of <i>cinereus</i>,? adult {\male}, from Bangkok, it is 61 mm., only 1 mm. shorter than in the skull from Toungoo, and the cranial ridges meet to form a low sagittal crest as in the {\male} from Naga Hills. But in another adult, probably {\male}, skull from Raheng the condylobase is 63 mm., but the total length is 68&#xBD; mm., 4&#xBD; mm. longer than in the skull from Bangkok, and the cranial ridges form a crest 4 mm. high. This suggests that the occipital and sagittal crests increase with age after the condylobase has attained its full length. There is no difference in size between {\male} and {\female} skulls, but the cranial ridges seem to be farther apart on the average in the {\female}.</p>

<p> <i>Nycticebus tenasserimensis</i>, Elliot, Rev. Primates, i, p. 25, 1912.</p>

<p> Locality of the <i>type</i>, Amherst, N. Tenasserim.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---TENASSERIM and S.W. Siam.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>N. coucang bengalensis</i> by the bifurcation of the stripe on the crown to join the dark area round the eyes, by the extension of the stripe above the ear almost to the point of bifurcation, and by the dark hue of the side of the neck, which is the same tint as the upper arm and confluent with the patch over the ear.</p>

<p>Fig. 50.---Tickell's Slow Loris <i>Nycticebus coucang tenasserimensis</i> from Amherst. (Adapted from Tickell's figure, but with the frontal stripes too pronounced.)</p>

<p>The type of this provisionally admitted race is the figure of an adult {\male} Slow Loris from Amherst recorded by Tickell in his MS. A considerably altered copy was published by Blanford as representing the Tenasserim variety of <i>N. tardigradus</i>, and on this evidence Elliot established his ``species.'' Quoting Blanford, he said the general colour was ``pale refescent.'' This is incorrect. In Tickell's description it is said to be ``pale tawny, a little dulled with greyish-brown, becoming greyish-white on the hands and feet, and almost greyish-white on the occiput and nape, with the middle of the back, the rump, the arm to the elbow, and the thighs orange tawny.; the dorsal line is continued from the crown as two faint lines to the space round the eyes; the sides of the neck, like the shoulders, are reddish-tawny, and from the same tint enveloping the ears passes a stripe which nearly reaches the vertex of the crown.'' </p>

<p>The description and figure of this specimen agree very closely with typical <i>N. coucang bengalensis</i>, except in the particulars mentioned in the diagnosis. n these the specimen approaches the next race, but the stripes on the head are not so broad and pronounced, the whole crown being whiter. It is a transitional form. Tickell stated that this Loris is found throughout Tenasserim and in Arakan as well, but no doubt he did not distinguish the Amherst specimen he described and figured from the Burmese Lorises I identify as <i>bengalensis</i>.</p>         

<p>A specimen from Mergui Town (Shortridge) (April) is referred to race. The coat is all woolly, and the general colour above is drabby-brown from the shoulders to the elbows and rump, with the legs a little greyer; but the cheeks, temples, and the whole of the neck are deep ashy-grey, as if the hairs had lost their white tips. It differs from the type of <i>tenasserimensis</i> in the strips from the eyes just failing to reach the stripe on the crown.</p>

<p>At Koh Lak in Peninsular Siam Kloss (Journ. Nat. Hist. Soc. Siam, ii, p. 77 1916, and p. 289, 1917) collected two Slow Lorises which he identified an <i>N. cinereus</i>. One of them agrees almost exactly in colour with examples of <i>N coucang bengalensis</i> from the Naga Hills, but has a smaller skull, measuring only 60 mm. in total length, the same as in many skulls of next race from the Malay Peninsula. The other, in the extension of the cranial stripe to join the coloured areas round the eyes and ears, comes close to the type of <i>N c. tenasserimensis</i>, and its skull measuring 62 mm. in total length, is almost the same as in the example assigned to <i>N c. tenasserimensis</i> from Mergui Town.</p>

<p>The skull, judging from the scanty records, is a little smaller on the average than in <i>bengalensis</i>, and thus approaches skulls from the Malay Peninsula, in five of which the condylobasal length ranges from 54 to 56 mm. The measurements of the skull of the type are taken from Tickell's figure drawn natural size.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i> not recorded, but, according to Thomas, Java.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The MERGUI ARCHIPELAGO, Malaya, Sumatra, Java.</p>

<p>Distinguished from the preceding two races by having the head, nape, and shoulders better coloured, not so white, with the stripe on the crown broad and dividing into four broad branches extending respectively to the ears and eyes. The size, also, both of the body and of the skull is a little smaller, and the general colour on the average brighter.</p>

<p>The only British Indian representative of this race known to me is a {\male} from King Island, Mergui Archipelago (Primrose), (December), The general colour is rich, rusty-ochreous above and below, becoming gradually paler distally on the arms and legs, but not white on the hands and feet, and with the chest a little greyer than the belly; the spinal stripe is well defined by patches of very deep brown on the fore back and between the shoulders, but is paler and redder on the nape, which is buffy-grey laterally; the centre of the crown is ochreous, and the stripes are defined by ashy-grey on the forehead and cheeks.</p>

<p>This specimen closely matches an example from Perak in the Malay Peninsula, except that the sides of the neck are greyer and the crown less extensively reddened. This specimen belongs to the from usually quoted as <i>malaianus</i> Anderson, which, in my opinion, indistinguishable from <i>javanicus</i> Geoffroy.</p>

<p>According to Blyth (Journ. As. Beng. xvi, p. 735, 1847) this ``darker coloured, more rufous Malayan form,'' which he cited as his var. B of             <i>N. tardigradus</i>, was brought to Calcutta for sale by vessels from the ports of Arkan, Burma, Malaya, and Singapore. He added that it is rare in Eastern Bengal but I can find no evidence that he had a specimen from that district. When Anderson described it as <i>N. tardigradus</i> var. <i>malaiana</i>, based on specimens from Malacca and Penang, he said it occurs in Chittagong and Arkan, but he cited no specimens in support of this statement (Cat. Mamm. Calc. Mus. p. 95, 1881). I do not believe it is found so far north.</p>

<p>* This species was based by Boddaert upon two distinguishable forms, ``The tailless Macauco'' of Pennant and ``Le paresseux pentadactyle du Bengale'' of Vosmaer. When Stone and Rehn revised the genus (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philad. liv, p. 141, 1902) they took as the type of <i>coucang</i> the Bengal Loris described by Vosmaer; and in this they were followed by some later authors, including Elliot, until 1922, when Thomas pointed out that in accordance with the generally accepted custom of selecting the form first quoted under the name of a species as its type, the ``tailless Macauco'' of Pennant is, <i>ipso facto</i>, the type of <i>coucang</i>, and this Loris is not the larger, white-headed northern form  <i>bengalensis</i>, but the smaller, more southern form with the well-coloured head.</p>

<p>These measurements suggest that <i>bengalensis</i> is a little larger  <i>coucang</i> from King Island was unmeasured, but six adult {\female} examples from various localities in the Malay Peninsula range in length of head and body from 11 to 12&#x2158; in., almost the same as in the three recorded examples of <i>tenasserimensis</i>.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---Very little is known about the breeding of <i>Nycticebus</i>, except that a single young one is, usually at all events, born at a time. In general habits there is probably no difference between the various races; but accounts have mostly been taken from the behaviour of captive specimens, observation of wild individuals being almost impossible owing to the species being exclusively nocturnal and an inhabitant of dense forests, where it seldom leaves the trees. According to Tickell it is slow in its movements in trees, but climbs readily with a tenacious grip, and on the ground progresses with a wavering kind of trot. By day it sleeps rolled up in a squatting attitude, with its head and hands buried between its thighs. When first caught it is savage and bites quickly and severely, with a grunt or growl. It feeds on plantains and other fruits and greedily devours insects of many kinds. In captivity it may become diurnal. One that Tickell had attempted to catch a cockroach some 10 or 12 inches distant on the floor of a room. The Loris stealthily stalked the insect till within striking distance then raising itself on its hind legs, ``flung itself'' at its prey with a swift grab---but missed it.</p>

<p> This account has since been confirmed and extended Shortridge recorded that the specimen he collected on Mergui Island, where the animal is apparently fairly well known, was very savage, growling like a cat when approached, and always ready to attack anything placed near it. According to Mackenzie the animal moves along a branch in a most peculiar way, very slowly and deliberately, putting the hind foot of one side right up to hand, then moves the hand, then the hind foot of the opposite side, then the hand, and so on, bending the back the while in a most extraordinary way. A specimen from Thaundaung, kept in captivity, never voluntarily came to the floor of its cage, but would hang from a branch by its hind legs to pink up anything and sometimes to drink. It stalked prey in the way described by Tickell, then seized it with a sudden pounce, usually grabbing it between the fingers and palm, sometimes stretching to its fullest extent to reach it, but always retaining the hold of its hind feet. It ate rice, fruit, insects of many kinds, its favourites being Longicorn beetles, cockroaches, crickets, and grass hoppers, and it was seen to catch moths on the wing. The stomach of a specimen captured near Kindat contained leaves and shoots, a beetle, and a piece of bone, apparently of a bird. The Chins, Mackenzie tells us, use the fur to stop bleeding, and say it is very efficacious.</p>

<p>Genus <b>LORIS E</b>. Geoffroy.</p>

<p> <i>Loris</i>, E. Geoffroy, Mag. Encycl. i, p. 48, 1796; and of all recent authors, including Osman Hill, Ceyl. J. Sci. (B), xviii, pp. 89-132, 1933.</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of the genus, <i>gracilis</i>, E. Geoffroy (&#x207C;<i>tardigradus</i> Linn.).</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---S. INDIA and CEYLON.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>Nycticebus</i> by its more slender build and relatively much longer and thinner limbs smaller hands and feet and less powerful digits, the hands smaller as compared with feet; nose projecting prominently beyond the lower jaw; ears similar in structure, but less reduced, not so concealed by the fur, with the supratragus and flap above it larger, more completely valvular, the flap which bears the deeper pocket-like depression larger, the margin of the pinna not so rounded, more or less angled anteriorly*, tail only very occasionally a few mm. long. Skull with interorbital septum very narrow, orbits more expanded, exceeding the width across the zygomatic arches; nasals and premaxill{\ae} produced in subtubular form beyond the level of the upper incisors; the palate produced beyond the level of the last upper molars, and the upper incisors subequal in size.</p>

<p>*Osman Hill was the first to describe the ear of <i>Loris</i>, but I cannot agree with his estimate of its peculiarities; and the figures he published of the ears of <i>Nycticebus, Loris</i>, and <i>Tarsius</i> are quite unlike the ears of the examples of those genera I have seen.</p>

<p>Like <i>Nycticebus, Loris</i>, contains a signal species.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, ``Madaras.''</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The EASTERN GHATS, westwards to Mangalore and MYSORE. Precise range to the north unknown.</p>

<p>Size, on the average, larger than in other races of <i>tardigradus</i>. Colour of the upper side, in good coat, typically greyish-brown, silvered to a varying extent, especially on the fore back and shoulders, and with indications of a darker median line on the fore back, the fur at the base being deep slate-grey; the flanks paler and passing into the usually clean white abdomen, the hairs of which are, with rare exceptions, white throughout; the cheeks entirely white, like the throat and chin; the limbs proximally about the same hue as the upper side, but becoming paler distally, especially the arms, which are whitish below the elbow; hands and feet white above.</p>

<p>The type of this race, labelled ``Madars,'' and presented by Edgar Thurston of the Christian College, was probably brought as a live specimen from the Eastern Ghats.</p>

<p>A good series of skins of this Loris collected by G. C. Shortridge in the Kolar district of E. Mysore, 2,700-3,000 ft. (October 12-20), shows some variations from the normal in colour. One skin is paler, more drabby, with no silvery tint above, and the belly has a yellowish tinge, with the hairs pale grey at the base. Another, in bad moulting coat, has also lost its silver-tipped hairs, and the general hue above is dark grey and buffy in patches. Two of them have the hind back- loins, and legs covered with pale dull ochreous or buffy wool, and sharply contrasted with the dark grey hue of the fore back and shoulders. Of three specimens collected by Baptista in the Chettiri Range, Salem, 2,000 ft. (June 8th), one has a decided buffy tinge in the dorsal pelage, thus approaching the Malabar race.</p>

<p>One {\male} Weighed by Shortridge was 12&#xBC; oz.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---Shortridge made some interesting observations on wild and captive specimens of this Loris in Mysore. The iris of the eye is chestnut, the pupil contracts to a nearly vertical slit, and when expanded shines with a golden-coppery light. Wild specimens in foliage are strikingly like the little Spotted Owl (<i>Athene brama</i>), have the same habit of swaying the head and, when fighting, utter a similar screech. They also make a faint chattering noise and a low growl when irritated. Their quarrelsomeness when kept together in a cage shows that they are not naturally gregarious. They would occasionally drop to the floor of the cage from a branch 3 or 4 ft. up, but are quite incapable of jumping even the shortest distance from branch to branch. Their movements along a branch are usually slow and deliberate, but much less so than <i>Nycticebus</i>. On the ground the movement is usually exactly like that of a monkey walking slowly, but they can run on the ground at quite a respectable pace, and Shortridge thinks that in Mysore they probably travel some distance from tree to tree. They are unable to swim, and when put into water merely move their limbs backwards and forwards without making any progress. They ate cooked rice and bananas and were particularly fond of grasshoppers, which they would hold in one hand munch. In the wild they are said to feed largely on insects and small lizards. A captive specimen kept by Kinnear killed and ate the heads of a jerboa and a gerbille, which were in the same cage. Females with two young were found on several occasions, and Shortridge thinks that twins are probably a common occurrence. On one occasion he captured a female with a three-quarter-grown young one clinging to her.</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, Huvinakadu Estate, Kutta, S. Coorg, 2,843 ft.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The MALABAR district of S. INDIA, the WYNAAD, S. COORG, and TRAVANCORE.</p>

<p>Distinguished from <i>lydekkerianus</i> on the average by its smaller size, tawnier or more ochreous tinge of the upper side, slightly darker underside and cheeks, the latter a little darker than the throat and chin, and the area round the eyes more rufous-brown.</p>

<p>The general colour is subject to a good deal of individual variation. The type from Kutta, S. Coorg, has the dorsal fur tawny-brown superficially, deep slate-grey at the base, with some silver-tipped hairs on the back, especially on the shoulders, and also on the hind legs; the lower side buffy-white, the hairs pale grey close to the skin, the throat white, and the cheeks grey and contrasted. Another from Virajpet S. Coorg, is more richly tinted than the last , the dorsal pelage being decidedly ochreous-brown with hardly any silvering. This specimen is very like some specimens of typical <i>tardigradus</i>. Av third, from Trivandrum, is darker, not so tawny as the type, more silvery on the fore back, with the cheeks paler less contrasted with the throat and the hairs of the belly whitish at the base. This approaches <i>lydekkerianus</i> and the northern Ceylonsese from <i>nordicus</i>.</p>

<p>The weight of the adult {\male} was 6 oz.</p>

<p>Although the Flesh-measurements and weight indicate a smaller race the <i>lydekkerianus</i>, there is very difference in the size of the skulls as shown in the table of measurements (p. 183).</p>

<p>According to a note accompanying Shortridge's specimens, this race, although apparently rare on the western side of India as far north as North Kanara, is probably fairly plentiful in Coorg; but it is not easy to find in the thick jungle owing to is nocturnal habits and concealment by day in the thick foliage of high trees. In some specimens, he observed a slender tail, up to 7 mm. long may be present.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---Low-country wet zone of CEYLON.</p>

<p>Resembling <i>malabaricus</i>, but smaller and apparently rather more rufous-brown above without silvering and brighter below, with the hairs extensively sooty at the base, brighter or duller yellowish distally, the throat whitish or yellow, the cheeks dusky and the area round the eyes brown.</p>

<p>This description, taken from two unmeasured specimens in the British Museum, one being the selected type of <i>zeylanicus</i> Lydd. from Peradeniya, agrees in essentials with the long description published by Hill, who states that the lumbar and sacral regions are sometimes frosted, but less in the {\female} than in the {\male}, the {\female} being further distinguished by being larger than the {\male} on the average and less rufous in general colour above.</p>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>*In his description of <i>zeylanicus</i> the only specimen Lydekker mentioned individually was a mounted one recently received from Ceylon/ This was marked ``type'' by Thomas. It is a representative of <i>nordicus</i>, resembling those collected by Mayor at Anuradhapura. But it is not the type of <i>zeylanicus</i>, because Lydekker's description was clearly taken from one of the two or perhaps both the ``reddish''examples of typical <i>tardigradus</i>  then in the British Museum, and does not apply in any way to the mounted specimen, of which the general tint is brownish-grey with a white belly. Since one of the two specimens Lydekker described came from Peradeniya, I select it as the type.</p>

<p>The weights, according to Hill, are : {\male}, 3 to 4&#xBD; oz.; {\female}, 3 to 4 oz.; the average being 3&#xBD; oz.</p>

<p>There are no skulls in the British Museum certainly assignable to this race, but, according to Hill, {\male} skulls range from 47 to 50 mm. and {\femals} skulls from 48 to 50 mm. in total length, the average of seven adult skulls being 48&#xBD; mm.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The dry zone of the N.P., N. C. P., and C. P. of CEYLON from just above sea-level up to 650 ft.</p>

<p>Possibly distinguishable from <i>lydekkerianus</i> by being slightly smaller and by having the fur in the middle of the ventral surface on the average greyer at the base, but otherwise the coloration is apparently the same.</p>

<p>In his key to the races of <i>L. tardigradus</i> Hill distinguished <i>nordicus</i>, the largest of the Ceylonese forms, form <i>lydekkerianus</i>, the largest of the Indian forms, by the greyness of the basal third of the ventral hairs, which he alleged to be white throughout in the Indian race; but these hairs are occasionally grey basally in the latter, <i>e. g</i>. in the type, and may be pale throughout in Ceylonese specimens.</p>

Both in measurements and weights these specimens agree very closely with those of <i>lydekkerianus</i> collected by Baptista on the Chettiri Range, Salem, which from their locality may be considered almost as topotypes of <i>lydekkerianus</i> recorded from ``Madras.''</p>

<p>Between the skulls of <i>nordicus</i> and <i>lydekkerianus</i>, as entered in the table, there is practically no difference. But in a long series of skulls, lent to me by Sir F Colyer, from Monaragala, in the dry zone of Uva, the average total and condylobasal lengths of 6 adult {\male} {\male} is 51 and 41&#x2154;, and of 8 adult {\female} {\female} 49&#xBD; and 41 mm. Unfortunately there are no skins; but Hill, who knew by report of the occurrence of <i>Loris</i> at this locality thought they would prove to be <i>nordicus</i>. If this guess was correct, the series of skulls from Monaragalla would make the average size of the skulls of <i>nordicus</i> less than of <i>lydekkerianus</i>. The skulls in question are intermediate in size between those of typical <i>tardigradus</i> and of <i>nordicus</i>.</p>

<p> <b>20 <i>e</i>. Loris tardigradus  grandis</b> Hill {amp; Philips.</p>

<p> <i>Loris tardigradus grandis</i>, Hill {amp; Philips, Ceyl. J. Sci. (B), xvii, p. 110, 1932;  Hill, Ceyl. J. Sci. (B), xviii, p. 117, p1. 7, fig. 1 {amp; p1. 8. fig. 2, 1933; Phillips, Man. Mamm. Ceylon, p. 34, pls. 4 {amp; 5 1935.</p>

<p> <i>Vernacular</i>.---The same as for the typical race with the addition of <i>Kalu unahapuluva</i> (Sinhalese) and <i>Kadu-papa</i> (Tamil).</p>

<p>Locality of the <i>type</i>, Mousakanda in Gammaduwa, 2,200 ft., C. P., Ceylon.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---``Probably throughout the lower foot-hills of the mountain cluster of the Central and Uva Provinces'' (Phillips), up to about 3,500 ft.</p>

<p>A little smaller on the average and with a fuller coat than <i>nordicus</i>, resembling it in dorsal coloration, but with the basal half of the hairs of the ventral surface and of the cheeks deep sooty-grey, and white-tipped hairs extend over the eye to the median frontal stripe.</p>

<p>This description is taken from the type, a young adult {\female}, the only example known to me. It bears out Hills's description of the race except in the dark tint of the hairs of the cheek, which from his account appear to be white to the base in the examples he recorded in 1933.</p>

<p>The approximate dimension (in English inches) according to Hill are:---</p>

<p>Average of 4 {\male} {\male} from Gammaduwa: head and body 8&#x2156;;  foot 1&#x2158;.</p>

<p>Average of 4 {\female} {\female} from Gammaduwa: head and body 9&#x2212;;  foot 1&#x2158;.</p>

<p>The weights are from 5&#xBD; to just over 7 oz.</p>

<p> <i>Habits</i>.---No doubt the Lorises of Ceylon resemble the south Indian form in habits; but the account given of the latter may be supplemented by the observation of Hill and Phillips on the Ceylonese races. The period of gestation is unknown, but, as Hill has pointed out, there is evidence that it is over three months. Lactation lasts for about one year, and the young, usually one, but occasionally two, are for a long time, wholly at first partly later dependent on the mother even availing themselves of her nursing when as much as half-grown and able to feed independently. Females have been observed suckling newly-born young and at the same nursing the one to which they had previously given birth.</p>

<p>In captivity according to Phillips, they show a special liking for plantains and eat papaws and other fruits, but seem to prefer insects or animal food of kind. In the wild state he thinks they are mainly carnivorous, feeding on insects small birds, lizards, and tree-frogs; but captive specimens would not touch small mammals, such as mice, shrews, and bats.</p>

<p>Like <i>Nycticebus</i> they capture prey, after a stealthy approach, with a lighting grab of both hands, and hold it in a tenacious grip while devouring it. Everything is consumed-feathers, scales, and bones of the vertebrates, and wings, legs, and the horny exoskeleton of insects.</p>

<p> <b>Order CARNIVORA</b>.</p>

<p>In their general organization the CARNIVORA, containing such familiar mammals as Cats, Dags, Bears, Weasels, etc., stand nearest to the INSECTIVORA (<i>q. v</i>., p. 11), of which they are a highly specialized offshoot. They are distinguished from them by the sum of a number of characters of which the most important perhaps are supplied by the teeth, especially those in the fore part of the jaws, which, on the whole, are very stable in arrangement and structure*. The incisors, almost always six in number above and below, are small, never prominent or widely separated, with the outer larger than the inner, more noticeably in the upper than the lower jaw, and form a regular straight or curved compact series between the piercing tusk-like canines, and there is always a space between the upper outer incisor and the upper canine, into which the lower canine fits when the mouth is closed. The premolars and molars always cuspidate or tubercular and rooted, are very variable in number and structure; but there is evidence that at an early stage in the evolution of the order the fourth upper premolar (<i>pm&sup4</i>) and the first lower moler (<i>mx<sub>1</sub></i>)&#x22BA;, which are opposed to one another, were enlarged and especially modified for cutting flesh-hence they are called the ``carnassials''---and constituted a ``point of the greatest mechanical efficiency'' in the jaws. The dominance of these teeth in species which have retained primitive predatory habits rendered the others of the series, especially those behind them of less importance in the same way as the large size of the canines deprived the premolars behind them of their use. Hence the reduction in the number or simplification of the postcanine teeth takes place at the anterior and posterior ends of the series &#x22B8;(see figs. 3 {amp; 4, pp. 4 {amp; 6).</p>

<p>Apart from the teeth the CARNIVORA are more highly organized on the whole than the INSECTIVORA, and have, in particular, a better developed brain, with convoluted cerebral hemispheres.</p>

<p>*Excluding the aberrant group PINNIPEDIA (seals and Walruses), which by their puzzling exclusion from the northern shores of the Indian Ocean do not fall within the limbs of the British Indian fauna. The PINNIPEDIA are a section of the Arctoid CARNIVORA (see below, p. 190) adaptively specialized for marine feeding, although breeding on land.</p>

<p>&#x22BA; The position of the number added to the letter symbolising the tooth indicates its belonging to the upper or lower jaw. </p>

<p>&#x22B8; The type of dentition above described has been lost in some mainly herbivorous forms, very noticeably in the Bears.</p>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Some special characters, both external and cranial, used in their classification must be referred to. In the head the muzzle nearly always has a typical rhinarium and philtrum and an adherent upper lip. In the predatory species the facial vibriss{\ae} are well developed, and there are two tufts of of genal vibriss{\ae}, an upper and a lower. These tactile organs may, however, be quite inconspicuous in some species that are mostly vegetable feeders. The ear varies considerably in size, and may be reduced to little more than a rim of thickened skin round the orifice. When well developed its posterior rim is generally provided with a supplementary flap of skin giving rise to a pocket-like structure, the <i>bursa</i>. (For these character see fig. 1, p. 2.)</p>

<p>Fig. 54.---The left upper carnassial (<i>pm&sup4</i>) of a Tiger (I), Wolf (II), and Bear (III). Upper row from the outer side, lower row from below. 1, anterior cusp (<i>parastyle</i>); 2, median cusp (<i>paracone</i>); 3, posterior cusp (<i>metacone</i>); 4, the inner lobe (<i>paracone</i>), its root not shown in upper fig. 1 ; 5, inner, posterior, unrooted cusp of Bear's tooth (after Flower).</p>

<p>The feet are typically pentadactyl, but by the loss of the loss of the first digit, almost always the smallest of the series, the number of digits may be reduced to four. They are provided with claws which vary in shape and size, in accordance with the use of the foot for running, climbing or digging. Sometimes the hind feet are modified for swimming. When the entire limbs are adapted for running or leaping the hind foot is lengthened has its heel or hock raised off the ground, and the sole down to the plantar pad usually clothed with hair, with at most traces of the metatarsal pads remaining. The fore foot is also usually hairy between the wrist and the plantar pad, with the outer carpal pad alone retained and the first digit, when present, is raised off the ground. In these cases the plantar and digital pads alone rest on the ground and the gait is digitigrade. The Cats, Hy{\ae}nas, and Dogs show the extreme of this specialization of the feet. At the opposite extreme are the Bears, in which the hind feet are short and broad and mostly naked from the heel; the five toes form a continuous lightly curved line, and all are in contact with the ground. They are called plantigrade because, when walking, the entire sole of the foot appears to be planted on the ground, although in really both the heel and wrist are raised to a certain extent. There is every gradation between these types, intermediate kinds of feet being called subplantigrade.</p>

<p>The tail is usually long in species which run, jump or climb, but it may be quite short and act merely as a covering to the underlying naked skin, as in bears. In otters it is very thick, and acts as a swimming propeller.</p>

<p>The anal and genital regions also supply useful systematic characters in the position of the prepuce, the length of the perin{\ae}um, and the presence or absence of scent-glands on it. There is also, except in the Bears, a pair of well developed glands within the anal orifice, and in connection with these a pouch or glandular area may be present round or above the anus.</p>

<p>In the skull., apart from the teeth, three sets of bones or areas are important, namely, the turbinals in the nasal passages, the auditory bulla, and the area in front of the latter low down in the temporal fossa. The bulla may be composed of a single bone, the tympanic, which primarily forms the floor of the auditory orifice, but may be developed into a tube or expanded into a thin-walled cavity; or it may be composed of two bones the tympanic, which forms its antero-external portion, and the entotympanic, forming its postero-internal portion; where these two bones meet a partition is developed dividing the cavity of the bulla into an outer and an inner chamber.</p>

<p>In the temporal fossa outside the foramen rotundum there is frequently a bony channel, the <i>alisphenoid canal</i>, through which a branch of the carotid artery runs. Its incidence is remarkable, and it has been much used in classification. It is probably a primitive character in the order which has been retained in some families, lost in others (see fig. 3 {amp; 4, pp. 4 {amp; 6).</p>

The same of an Indian Jackal (<i>Canis</i>), illustrating the difference between the {\AE}luroid and Arctoid Carnivora in the arrangement of the turbinal bones. <i>cr</i>, cribriform plate through which the olfactory nerves enter the nasal chambers; <i>an</i>, anterior nares; <p>pn</p>, posterior nares; <i>nt</i>, the naso-turbinal, which is a branch of <i>et</i>, the ethmo-turbinal; <i>mt</i>, the maxillo-turbinal.</p>

<p>In his classification of the Indian CARNIVORA, Blanford followed Flower in assigning them to the suborder FISSIPEDIA, which have normal feet, as opposed to the PINNIPEDIA, in which the feet are converted into swimming paddles. The FISSIPEDIA, which alone are represented in the Indian fauna, were divided into three main groups, the {\AE}LUROIDEA, compriing the Cats, Civets, Momgooses, and  Hy{\ae}nas, the CYNOIDEA, the Wolves, Jackels, and Foxes, and the ARCTOIDEA, the Bears, Raccoons, Weasels, Otters, etc. But quite obviously from his key this classification is unsatisfactory; and it has been abandoned with the discovery that the Dog-family is closely akin to those classified under the ARCTOIDEA, that the Hy{\AE}nas do not differ from the rest of the {\AE}LUROIDEA, as was supposed, in the structure of the bulla, and that the turbinal bones, which had not them been studied in this connection, supply a character by which the CARNIVORA may be divided into the two groups, {\AE}LUROIDEA* and ARCTOIDEA.</p>

<p>The two suborders may be briefly diagnosed and contrasted as follows:---</p>

<p> <i>a</i>.Ethmo-turbinals very large, occupying the greater
			part of the nasal chambers and extending forwards
			over and between the smaller maxillo-turbinals,
			almost to the anterior orifice of the chambers.
			The auditory bulla composed of two bones and 
			divided by a partition into two chambers. Cowper's          <p>[p. 190.</p>
			glands absent; at most a small penis bone</p>    <p> <b>{\AE}luroidea</b>, </p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Ethmo-turbinals excluded from the anterior orifice
				of the nasal chambers by the enlarged maxillo-
				turbinals. The auditory bulla composed of a 
				single bone, the tympanic; its cavity typically 
				undivided; when divided the partition is not
				homologous to that of the {\AE}uroid bulla.
				Cowper's glands, associated with the generative
				organs of the male, present; a large penis bone in
				all Asiatic species.</p>                <p> <b>Arctoidea</b>.</p>

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p>* This name, meaning cat-like, has been objected to, and HERPESTOIDEA, Mongoose-like, substituted on the grounds that the generic name <i>{\AE}lurus</i> or <i>Ailurus</i> is the admitted name for the Cat-Bear or Panda, one of the ARCTOIDEA. But for the sake of convenience I here retain the long-established name {\AE}LUROIDEA, which according to is meaning is appropriate.</p>

<p> <b>Family FELID{\AE}</b>.</p>

<p>In their external characters the Felid{\ae} (Cats) come nearest, to the Viverrid{\ae}, especially to the Lingsangs, which have the retractile claws and claw-sheaths typical of most cats, the penis short and close to the scrotum, and no perineal glands. But in the Felid{\ae} the plantar pads of the front and hind feet form compact three-lobed cushions, there is a single carpal pad on the fore foot, and the hind foot has only four toes and no trace of metatarsal pads. The typical facial vibriss{\ae} are well developed, with the exception of the interramal tuft, which is absent. The ear is tolerably large, has a simple supratragal ridge, and a well-developed marginal bursa. There are two or three pairs of mamm{\ae}.</p>

<p>The skull has no alisphenoid canal, the jaws are shortish and massive, and the auditory bulla is typically high and rounded. In the mouth there is almost always a large space the postcanine space, due to the loss of the true first premolar and the very small size or absence of the second in the upper jaw, to the loss of the true first and second premolars in the lower jaw and to the uplift of the anterior portion of the mandible carrying the canines and incisors. This space is to give penetrating depth to the tusk-like canines. The single upper larger premolar, morphologically the third, which precedes the ``carnassial'' and the two below, morphologically the third and fourth, have triangular compressed crowns with a single large pointed cusp and smaller cusps behind and in front at its base. Then crown of the upper carnassial (<i>pmx&sup4</i>) is also compressed, its outer cutting portion consisting of three cusps set in a line, the first low, the second (paracone) high and pointed, the third or posterior (metacone) lower and more blade-like; the inner lobe (protocone) of the tooth is set far forwards, small, and has at most a single cusp, but in some cases it is reduced to vanishing point. The single upper molar is a small nearly functionless tooth with its long axis set transversely. The lower carnassial, the single lower molar, is very highly specialized. Its crown carries two compressed blade-like pointed cusps, the paraconid and protoconid, but there is no trace of the metaconid on the inner side of the latter, and the ``heel'' of the tooth found in most other Carnivores is at most represented by a small tubercle. This tooth is always smaller than the upper carnassial.</p>

<p>In the classification of the Felid{\ae} a part of the skeleton is used which although primarily independent of the skull, has become secondarily attached to it in the Mammalia. This is the hyoidean apparatus (see fig. 57), of which the main portion is a U-shaped bone, the hyoid embracing the top of the windpipe. The larynx, containing the vocal chords, open between the two arms, which are directed backwards. In most mammals this bone is attached to the side of the back of the skull close to the mastoid process on each side by a series of three bones closely jointed together and arising from the forepart of the U-shaped bone. This is the suspender, or <i>suspensorium</i>, of the hyoid. Normally the suspensorium holds the larynx and the back of the tongue close under the base of the skull,admitting only comparatively slight movement of these parts in a vertical plane. But in some cases the bones of the suspensorium are wholly or partly replaced by an elastic tendon or ligament which allows the larynx to be depressed or elevated to a greater or less extent.</p>

<p>In a paper, ``The Classification of existing Felid{\ae}'' (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.(8) xx, p. 332, 1917), I made use of the modifications of this structure in subdividing the family. Other characters employed were supplied by the skull and feet.</p>

<p>Many of the zoologists of olden times could perceive that the existing Felid{\ae} fall into a number of natural groups, to which generic names were attached, sometimes with no attempt to diagnose them. But the conception of the affinities of the species was mostly hopelessly vague, and far too many names were proposed either in a generic or subgeneric sense. Admittedly the classification is difficult, and later authors followed the easier course of assigning all the species but one to the genus <i>Felis</i>, the only species to which separate generic rank was given being the Hunting Leopard or Cheetah. This was the classification adopted by all mammalogists, including Blanford, until about twenty years ago. But in my opinion it embodies an erroneous conception of the affliation of the species, since the Cheetah appears to be more nearly akin to the ordinary Cats than the latter are to Lions, Tigers, and their allies, which have a highly modified hyoidean apparatus, the Cheetah resembling the ordinary Cats in the normal structure of the system of bones. </p>

<p>Fig. 57.</p>

<p>A. Left half of the hyoidean apparatus of a Tiger, showing the ligament between the upper and lower bones, the ligament in this case very much shortened thickened, and twisted by methylated spirit.</p>

<p>B. The same of the common House-Cat, showing the complete chain of bones found in all the Felid{\ae} except the Pantherin{\ae}.</p>

<p>The Cheetah, called by Blanford <i>Cyn{\ae}lurus</i>, but now known as <i>Acinonyx</i>, was apart from its general build, distinguished by its so-called non-retractile claws. The main distinctive character of its foot lies in the complete loss of all trace of the lobes of skin at the tips of the toes, which in other Cats to a varying degree constitute sheaths for the claws, protecting their tips when retracted. In the most perfectly developed foot in the family there is a pair of these skin-lobes to the claws of the four main digits, and as a rule in this case the skin or ``web'' between the digits is continued up to the digital pads. But in several of the ordinary cats some of the lobes may be undeveloped, the others reduced in size and the webs much less extensive, so that the foot structurally approaches that of the Cheetah.</p>

<p>The Cats, which are the most highly organized of all the CARNIVORA, are found almost all over the world up to the limit of tree-growth, except in the Australian Region and Madagascar. They are essentially predatory, feeding mostly on freshly-killed mammals and birds; but many of them will eat carrion and kill and eat reptiles, frogs, frogs, and fishes, and occasionally insects.</p>

<p>Many are essentially forest species; others inhabit open grassland or semi-desert rocky districts, wherever, indeed, prey is available.</p>

<p>I divide the Felid{\ae} into the following submilies:---</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Hyoidean apparatus modified by the conversion
			 of the median part of the suspender into a long
			 elastic tendon; paws with complete claw-                 <p>[p.195.</p>
			 sheaths</p>                                   <p> <b>Pantherin{\ae}</b>,</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Hyoidean apparatus of the normal mammalian
			type, the suspender cobsisting of a chain of
			bones jointed end to end.</p>

<p> <i>b</i>. Paws with more or less well-developed cutaneous
			lobes constituting sheats for the claws when
			retracted</p>                                  <p> <b>Felin{\ae}</b>, p. 243.</p>

<p> <i>\'b</i>. Paws without trace of cutaneous  lobes            <p>[p.322.</p>
			constituting sheaths for the claws.</p>       <p> <b>Acinonychin{\ae}</b>,</p>

<p>Subfamily <b>PANTHERIN{\AE}</b>.</p>

<p>The suspender (suspensorium) of the hyoid modified from the normal mammalian type by the replacement of the median bone of the chain by a long, elastic tendon conferring great mobility upon the larynx and permitting the back of the mouth to be greatly distended. The tips of the digits of both fore and hind feet have a cutaneous lobe on the outer and inner side of the claws so that the claws, when retracted, are completely sheathed and the interdigital web extends to the  digital pads.</p>

<p>Fig. 58.</p>

<p>A. Lower side of right fore paw of a Leopard with the toes spread, the claws extruded, and the hair clipped close to show the pads, the interdigital webs, and the lobes of skin which act as sheaths to the claws when retraced.</p>

<p>B. Lower side of right hind paw of the same.</p>

<p>The structure of the hyoid in this subfamily is associated with the voice. The sexual call, where known, <i>i, e</i>., in the Lion, Tiger, Leopard, and  Jaguar, is a definite roar--it is not recorded in the Snow-Leopard--and pleasure or content is not expressed by ``purring'' as in the rest of the family.</p>

<p> <i>Type</i> of <i>Panthera pardus</i> Linn.; of <i>Tigeris, tigeris</i> Linn.; of <i>Leo, leo</i> Linn.*.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.---The greater part of temperate and tropical Asia from the Caucasus and Mongolia to Java and Bali, and most of Africa except the Sahara; tropical America.</p>

<p>* By modern authors the three well-known species here assigned to <i>Panthera</i> are regarded as representing distinct genera under the names cited. But in the three papers, quoted below, on Tigers and on the Panthers and Lions of Asia, and published in the Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. 1929-30, I have shown that the cranial and dental characters relied on to distinguish them generically completely break down when a large series of skulls examined. It is needless to repeat the facts. The prevalent external differences between the three species, when adult, are well known, but are, in my opinion, only of specific value. Their citation under different generic names completely obscures their kinship, which is undeniably close.</p>

<p>Dorsal profile of the skull flattish or tolerably evenly convex, not concave where the muzzle passes into the frontal interorbital area, which is not noticeably elevated, and the area behind the elevation less steeply sloped; the basicranial axis nearly horizontal; a wide notch between the glenoid process and the bulla; bulla with the inner chamber large, the outer small, the partition between them close to the external auditory meatus; mandible with a sloping, convexly rounded chin.</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Pattern of stripes or spots or both combined,
			  usually present in the cubs, lost or very nearly so
			  in the adult, in which the general colour varies
			  from tawny-brown to greyish; a black tuft on          <p>[p. 210.</p>
			  the tip of the tail; male usually with mane.</p>   <p> <i>leo</i> (Linn.),</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Pattern of stripes or spots retained throughout

<p> <i>Key to the Species based on Normal Differences on the Skulls</i>.</p>

<p> <i>a</i>. Skull large, in adult {\male} {\male} up to about 13 or 15 in. long.
	<i>b</i>. Nasals projecting beyond maxill{\ae}, frontal area
				elevated, facial portion shorter as compared
				with cranial and less massive, inferior edge of    <p>[p.199.</p>
				lower jaw not convex in the middle</p>         <p> <i>tigris</i> (Linn.),</p>

				of lower jaw lightly convex in the middle.</p>    <p> <i>leo</i> (Linn.),</p>

<p> <i>\'a</i>. Skull smaller, in adult {\male} {\male} up to about 9 in.,

<p>In addition to the three species above mentioned, <i>Panthera</i> includes the Jaguar (<i>Panthera onca</i>) of America, which is most nearly related to the Leopard (<i>P .pardus</i>), resembling it in the nature of its pattern and sexual call, but differing in its larger size, on average, relatively bigger head, and considerably shorter tail.</p>

<p>Typical locality (traditionally fixed), Bengal.</p> 

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.----Practically the whole of Asia in suitable localities, eastward of a line from the Caucasian area and Afghanistan to Manchuria and Korea, but omitting the Tibetan Plateau, most of INDIA, and extending from BURMA and the Malay Peninsula through the Sunda Islands to Bali, east of Java, but not found in Ceylon.</p> 

<p>The largest of the existing species of Felid{\ae}, apart from the Lion, which it rivals in size, and distinguished from the other species of Pantherin{\ae} by the sum of a number of characters, more particularly by the highly specialized pattern of numerous, nearly vertical dark stripes extending from the spine over the flanks to the belly, generally broken up into smaller, simple or looped stripes, and always, in normal skins, conspicuous against the bright typically reddish or yellowish tan colour of the upper side and the pale, typically white hue of the underside. A conspicuous pale, typically white patch over the eye is also distinctive, and a peculiarity of the reddish hair of the interspaces is their tolerably uniform hue, without trace of black speckling, all the black in the pelage being concentrated in the stripes.</p>

<p>The head is marked with short transverse stripes on the crown, with longitudinal vibrissal stripes on the white upper lip, and an irregular pattern-some longitudinal, some vertical---on the cheeks which are white in their lower half like the chin and throat a long vertical stripe descending in front of the ear; the ears are black at the back, with a white patch in the upper half; on the nape the stripes are few, thin, and obliquely longitudinal. On the spine the stripes of the two sides typically meet and form forwardly jutting angles. The fore leg externally is generally without stripes, and a considerable area of the shoulder above it is not infrequently unstriped. On the hind quarters the stripes are narrower and closer set, and low down on the thigh they pass into irregular transverse stripes extending to the hock. The inside of the fore and hind limbs is white, with a few stripes. The tail is heavily but irregularly banded, typically loses its bright colour in the distal half above, and has a black tip, but no tuft.</p> 

<p>From sportsmen's records it seems that the tail is, on the average less than half the length of the head and body; in some cases it is considerably less. On the other hand it is sometimes considerably more, nearly as long in proportion as in typical leopards (see Sterndale's records, p. 205).</p>

<p>In both sexes there is always a fringe of hair, varying in length which starts just above the ear 0in front and descends to the throat, as in the lion; but, unlike the latter, the hair on the top of the neck over a wide area grows backwards in the same direction as that of the head and the spine, only on the neck does it usually grow forwards from a whorl in front of the shoulder and, passing beneath the ear, meets the backwardly hairs of the cheek at the fringe; but the direction here is variable, and may be affected by additional whorls. On the nape the hair is always apparently longer than on the body and may be long enough to  constitute a small mane.</p> 

<p>The <i>skull</i> (see fig. 59) is distinguished by its large size, only rivalled in the Felid{\ae} by that of the lion, from which it is not always easy to distinguish when a large series of both is examined. The tiger's skull. however, is, on the average, at least shorter in its facial and longer in its cranial portions, measured from the postorbital process; it is usually more arched, owing to the brow being higher and the sagittal crest lower; its nasals are longer, overlap the maxill{\ae} behind to a greater extent, and the anterior nares are narrower; the lower edge of the mandible is not convex in the middle, but is concave in front of the angular process, so that the skull rest steadily on a flat surface and does not ``rock'' backwards and forwards; finally the inner lobe of the upper carnassial (<i>pm&sup4</i>) is a little larger.</p>

<p> <i>Distribution</i>.--Practically throughout INDIA from the Himalayas, where it may ascend to 6,000 or 7,000 ft., southwards, but not in the deserts of Rajputana, the Punjab, Cutch, and Sind, and exterminated or very scarce in certain districts where it was formerly plentiful. Also throughout BURMA in suitable localities*.</p>

<p>* The Burmese tiger is provisionally identified as <i>P.t. tigris</i>. There is some evidence that it may prove to be a distinguishable race; but I have not seen sufficient skins and skulls to establish this point.</p>

<p>One of the largest of the races, only a little, if at all, smaller on the average than the Mongolian and Manchurian race (<i>P. t. longipilis</i>), but distinguished from it and from the Chinese race (<i>styani</i>) and the Persian or Caucasian race (<i>P. t. septentrionalis</i>) by its shorter and winter coat, and from the last also by its fewer, more widely spaced stripes. Considerably larger than the three races from Sunda Islands, Sumatra (<i>P. t. sumatr{\ae}</i>) Java (<i>P. t. sondaica</i>), and Bali (<i>P. t. balica</i>), and also less fully and closely striped.</p> 

<p>Fig. 59.--Skull of Tiger from the Central Provinces, showing the shape characteristic of the Indian race.</p>

<p>A good many of the skins of British Indian tigers presented to the British Museum are more or less faded from being exhibited or exposed as rugs, but several are unfaded and exhibit the characteristic bright orange-red hue, and are practically indistinguishable in colour, although coming from the following widely separated localities:---United Provinces (Major G. Burrard), Bengal (Col. Sanderson), Pennghot, Mirzapur (S. Wyndham), Chanda, C.P. (C. E. Hewetson), Kadra, N. Kanara (N. B. Kinnear), Travancore (the Conservater of Forests), and the Thaungyin Valley, Amherst Tenasserim (E. H. Peacock). The last does not bear out the supposition that Burmese tigers are richer in colour than Indian tigers. No two skins are alike in pattern, the stripes varying individually in thickness, looping and the extent to which they are broken up.</p>

<p>Although only two of the skins are dated, many of the others exhibit interesting differences in the coat. Of the dated skins a {\female} Mirzapore (November) has the coat roughish, but with hardly any wool and about 18 nm. long on the back, 25 mm. on the nape, and from 45 to 50 mm. on the cheek. The other, a {\male} from Central India (H. H. The Maharaj Holkar) (February), has a little wool, a roughish, slightly longer coat, about 21 mm. on the back, 31 mm. on the nape, and from 50 to 70 mm. on the cheek. These skins, of different sexes, are very much alike, allowing for the increase in the coat from November to February. Neither has what can be called a mane on the nape. But in two, undated, from the Nepal Tarai, a {male} (Col. R. L. Kennion), with the coat on the body without wool and only about 12 mm. long, has a distinct mane, 66 mm. (2&#xBD;in.) on the nape, shortening to 33 mm. towards the shoulders and the cheek-fringe up to 85 mm. or more (3&#xBD;in.). A {\female} (Sir R. Dane), with a similar short, clearly summer coat, has the nape-hairs only 25 mm. (1 in.) and the cheek-fringe 50 (2 in.). Since these skins are in summer coat the difference between them in length of the hair on the nape and cheek might reasonably be regarded as sexual and comparable in a small way to the usual sexual difference in lions. But this is not borne out by three undated skins from the Central Provinces (Sir R. Dane). A {male} from Raipur has the coat smooth, without wool, and quite short, about 8 mm. only on the back, 17 mm., not constituting a mane, on the nape, and about 50 mm. on the cheek. A {\female} from Balaghat, on the contrary, has the coat about 18 mm., with a little wool, on the back a mane of 56 mm. on the nape and the cheek-fringe about 62 mm. In this case the differences are apparently seasonal. The third skin, a {\male} from Baslar, has the coat about 12 mm., without the nape-hairs about 25 mm., and the cheek fringe 50 mm. Unless, as is possible, there was a mistake in the labelling when the skins were dressed, it is the {\female} that has the mane in this case. The skulls show the sexes.</p>

<p>Other undated skins from scattered localities show similar variations indicating seasonal change. A {\male} from Bengal (Col. Sanderson) has a sleek coat , with no wool, only about 8 mm. long on the back and 14 mm. on the nape; whereas another from Danta Mahi Kanta, Gujarat (Major G. H. O' Donnell) has a rougher coat, with a little wool, about 25 mm. long and on the nape about 40 mm. The hair on the belly also varies greatly, being typically, but not always, longer than on the body. According to Dunbar Brander tigers in the Central Provinces rapidly moult the winter coat in March, there being a great difference between skins at the ends of January and the end of March.</p>               

<p> <i>Colour Varieties of Indian Tigers</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from comparatively slight individual differences in depth of hue, Indian tigers sometimes exhibit partial or complete albinism. In most of the cases of so-called ``white'' tigers the stripes are dark brown or reddish-black, and stand out boldly against the white ground-colour. This type has been recorded from Orissa, Bilaspur, Sohagpur, and Rewa. One from Mirzapur (Mrs. Craigie Halkett) is similar, but has the stripes tan. A wholly white tiger, with the pattern only visible under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tiger, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menageric in the early part of the nineteenth century and described by Hamilton-Smith. It was probably an Indian specimen. Probably similar to this, although the stripes were not mentioned, were couple of young tigers with pink eyes and apparently ``pure albinos.'' recorded from Cooch Behar in 1922 by V N. Narayan*.</p>

<p>Black tigers also have been reported, but no skins have come to hand, and some of them have turned out to be ``black panthers.'' One that was sighted near Bhamo, but not secured, is said to have left ``pug-marks'' too big for a leopard's ! This was recorded by Mr. Hauxwell (Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. xxii, p. 788). The story of another that was shot near Chittagong in 1846. and seen in a state of putrefaction in the jungle by Mr. C. T. Buckland, is told in `The Field,' 1889, p. 73, and a dead one in a similar condition, was said to have  been found the Lushai Hills (`The Field,' 1928, p. 656). The evidence, however, is clearly incomplete. There is no known reason why tigers should not be black, like leopards and jaguars; but at present their existence can be neither asserted nor denied.</p>
